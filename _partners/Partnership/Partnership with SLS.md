Partnership with SLS
===================

 SLS is built as an open system that can supplement its core resources and features with external content and tools.

 SLS currently

- works with various external content providers/developers to build/procure SLS content,
- whitelists websites which can be iframed within SLS, e.g. Padlet, Deck Toys, Kahoot,
- integrates with apps through its Application Development Framework, e.g. MySkillsFuture, and
- incorporates external engines to enhance SLS capabilities, e.g. Text-to-Speech and Speech Evaluation engines.
 
   
   
SLS Partnership Principles
==========================

   
Whitelisted or integrated content/tools **should not**:

- Duplicate current or upcoming SLS core resources/features (but they **can** offer enhanced or customised content/tools);
- Solicit further business in-app, especially from students; or
- Promote undesirable content or teaching and learning behavior, e.g. test/exam drill and practice.
