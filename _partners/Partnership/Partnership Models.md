<h1 id="partnership-models">Partnership Models</h1>
<p>SLS offers the following models for companies or agencies to form partnerships with the SLS:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Content Development</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>MOE currently procures quality content through its various curricular branches or engages external content developers to develop SLS resources.</li>
<li>MOE is looking at accelerating such external content procurement and creation, i.e. <ul>
<li>In formal curriculum, particularly if the content is delivered through non-traditional media, e.g. video, AR/VR, games, interactives/simulations.</li>
<li>In informal curriculum in support of student self-initiated learning, e.g. sustainability, STEAM areas, Maker education.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Websites/Apps</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>SLS can whitelist content/tools which are offered freely or have a free tier if they do not conflict with its <a target="_blank" href="/partners/partnership/partnership-with-sls/">partnership principles</a>. Content/tools which were previously being marketed directly to schools or teachers as standalone offerings can now be presented holistically with other content/tools used in SLS resources.</li>
<li>Companies can further discuss integration opportunities with SLS, particularly if they are already LTI 1.3 compliant and have experience integrating their apps with other Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and have a significant user base amongst Singapore schools.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>External Engines</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>SLS has built proprietary APIs to leverage external engines that offer enhanced capabilities in text-to-speech and speech evaluation. External engines can be integrated into SLS through the <a target="_blank" href="/files/Partnerships/adpspecifications21.pdf">Application Development Framework (ADF)</a>.</li>
<li>Companies possessing external engines with advanced capabilities can: <ul>
<li>Offer the capability for integration with SLS as a standalone service,</li>
<li>Offer the capability as a separate service for integration with SLS (if it is currently part of a broader product), or</li>
<li>Offer consulting and system integration services that can bring together SLSâ€™s existing APIs and current integration flows with existing cloud services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies or agencies that are interested to partner with SLS can approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/about-us/organisation-structure">relevant MOE divisions</a> to indicate their interest.</li>
<li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/sls-partnerships-contact">SLS Partnerships Team.</a></li>
</ul>
