<h1 id="partnership-models">Partnership Models</h1>
<p>We offer the following models for companies or agencies to form partnerships with the SLS:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Content Development</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>MOE currently procures quality content that is aligned to its curriculum or engages external content developers to create and customise resources for use by students and teachers in SLS.</li>
<li>MOE is looking at accelerating such external content procurement and creation, i.e. <ul>
<li>In formal curriculum, create or procure interactive digital resources and content such as video, AR/VR, games and interactives/simulations. Where possible to weave the digital resources and content into a digital textbook for the secondary school level, based on MOE subject-specific syllabuses.</li>
<li>In informal curriculum, create or procure interactive digital resources and content to enable students to learn on their own based on the following areas: Sustainability, STEM, heritage and culture etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Websites/Apps</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>SLS can whitelist content/tools which are offered freely or have a free tier if they do not conflict with its <a target="_blank" href="/partners/partnership/partnership-with-sls/">partnership principles</a>. Content/tools which were previously being marketed directly to schools or teachers as standalone offerings can now be presented holistically with other content/tools used in SLS resources.</li>
<li>Companies can further discuss integration opportunities with SLS, particularly if they are already LTI 1.3 compliant and have experience integrating their apps with other Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and have a significant user base amongst Singapore schools.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>External Engines</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>SLS has built proprietary APIs to leverage external engines that offer enhanced capabilities in text-to-speech and speech evaluation. External engines can be integrated into SLS through the <a target="_blank" href="/files/Partnerships/adpspecifications21.pdf">Application Development Framework (ADF)</a>.</li>
<li>Companies possessing external engines with advanced capabilities can: <ul>
<li>Offer the capability for integration with SLS as a standalone service,</li>
<li>Offer the capability as a separate service for integration with SLS (if it is currently part of a broader product), or</li>
<li>Offer consulting and system integration services that can bring together SLSâ€™s existing APIs and current integration flows with existing cloud services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies or agencies that are interested to partner with the SLS Office can approach:</p>
