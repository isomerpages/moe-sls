<p>The SLS Sandbox environment is a mirror of the SLS Production environment. It enables Sandbox account holders to explore SLS features prior to their release in the Production environment.</p>
<p>Any action done within this environment will have no impact on the actual SLS accounts. This would also mean that resources developed in the Sandbox cannot be transferred to the actual SLS environment.</p>
<p> If you are interested to develop content/tools for SLS, or to find out more about its latest features and capabilities, you can apply for an <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/sls-sandbox-form">SLS Sandbox account</a>
