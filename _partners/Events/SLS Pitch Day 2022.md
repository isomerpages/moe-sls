Welcome to SLS Pitch Day
------------------------

---

 SLS Pitch Day is a platform for interested participants to propose products and services that would be useful for teaching and learning and have potential for integration with SLS.

It allows an opportunity to connect, discuss and share with MOE divisions on products that may meet their needs.

 Shortlisted proposals will be presented by submitting teams to a panel comprising members of MOE's senior management.

Participants will submit proposals according to the focus tracks and areas specified in the task brief.

 All proposals will be reviewed by representatives from various MOE divisions and the shortlisted teams will present their proposal to a panel of senior management.

The product pitch will be in the form of a live pitch (and/or a demo) to be made within 20 minutes, inclusive of set-up and Q&A.

Selected proposals will be followed up on for further exploration by MOE.

You can refer to more information [here](https://www.go.gov.sg/slsinfopack).
