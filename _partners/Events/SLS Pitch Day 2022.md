<h2>Welcome to SLS Pitch Day</h2>
<hr>
 SLS Pitch Day is a platform for interested participants to propose products and services that would be useful for teaching and learning and have potential for integration with SLS.

It allows an opportunity to connect, discuss and share with MOE divisions on products that may meet their needs.

 Shortlisted proposals will be presented by submitting teams to a panel comprising members of MOE's senior management.

<h2>Format</h2>
<hr>        
Participants will submit proposals according to the focus tracks and areas specified in the task brief.

 All proposals will be reviewed by representatives from various MOE divisions and the shortlisted teams will present their proposal to a panel of senior management.

The product pitch will be in the form of a live pitch (and/or a demo) to be made within 20 minutes, inclusive of set-up and Q&amp;A.

Selected proposals will be followed up on for further exploration by MOE.

You can refer to more information [here](https://www.go.gov.sg/slsinfopack).

<h2>Rules and Regulations</h2>
<hr>    
 Participants must submit their proposals using the provided template.

 A guide to the scoring system used will be provided (refer to [information pack for more details](https://www.go.gov.sg/slsinfopack)).

Proposals must be submitted on time. Late submissions will be asked to participate in the next Pitch Day instead.

The judges' decision is final. No appeals will be entertained.

<h2> After the Pitch</h2>
<hr>    
If your proposal has been selected for further exploration, a team from MOE will contact you.

 Regardless of selection outcome, all proposals will be featured on our Pitch Day Showcase jpgage after the SLS Pitch Day.
