<h1>SLS Launchpad 2024</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Event Overview</h4>
<p>
	SLS Launchpad is an event that aims to foster closer collaboration between SLS Office, MOE HQ, schools and teacher developers who are actively engaged in Edtech explorations. Through this session, participants gain insights on how the SLS supports the EdTech ecosystem, and some innovation projects that are integrated with SLS.
</p>
<p>
	This year's session was held on 29 May 2024 at MOE Balestier and was jointly organised by the SLS Office and Classroom of the Future (CotF).

<h4>Event Takeaways</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Supporting the EdTech Ecosystem</strong>
<br>
<p>The SLS actively supports the EdTech ecosystem through its comprehensive Partnership and Integration Framework. This framework helps every stage of EdTech development, ensuring that innovative tools can be integrated seamlessly with SLS. Some of the key stages of support include:
</p>
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	<li><strong>Ideation</strong>:&nbsp;SLS offers detailed information on its current and future capabilities and provides platforms for feedback and engagement, such as the Partners Engagement Session and Launchpad events.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Solutioning</strong>:&nbsp;SLS publishes clear integration standards and offers consultation sessions to help providers integrate their tools effectively.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Proof of Concept and Prototyping</strong>:&nbsp;The SLS Partnership Team provides guided support through the whitelisting or integration approval and development process.
	</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Innovation Projects in SLS</strong>
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>The SLS fosters innovation by supporting new ideas from their inception to full-scale implementation. Innovation projects often start as school-level prototypes addressing specific needs. To help these projects scale, SLS encourages collaboration with HQ divisions for additional funding beyond standard school resources.
</li>
	<li>Providers can explore SLS capabilities, consult the SLS Partnership Team, and participate in events like the <a href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/teachers/sls-events/visit-sls-grange/" target="_blank">Genius Cafe</a> to refine their ideas. The Partnership Team can help innovators identify the specific value-add their proposed idea offers beyond SLS’s current or future capabilities. They can assess if this value-add is significant enough for long-term scaling or if the tool will likely remain an alternative within SLS.
	</li>
	<li>There are three pathways for scaling innovations within SLS: school-wide use as standalone or integrated apps, cluster-wide sharing with potential funding from cluster resources or HQ divisions, and MOE-wide promotion through centralised funding. By working closely with the SLS Partnership Team, providers can ensure their innovations receive the support needed to make a significant impact.&nbsp;

	<li><strong>Briefing on CotF Ideathon 2024&nbsp;
</strong>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	<li>The Ideathon focused on fostering innovation and addressing educational challenges. Aligned with the "Transforming Education through Technology" Masterplan 2030, it provided a collaborative platform where participants identified teaching and learning challenges, shared problem statements, and proposed potential solutions.
