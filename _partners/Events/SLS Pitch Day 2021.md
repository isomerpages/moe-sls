<h2 class="section-title">Welcome to SLS Pitch Day</h2>

<hr>
<p>SLS Pitch Day is a platform for interested participants to propose products and services that would be useful for teaching and learning and have potential for integration with SLS. </p>

<p>It allows an opportunity to connect, discuss and share with MOE divisions on products that may meet their needs.</p>

<p>Shortlisted proposals will be presented by submitting teams to a panel comprising members of MOE's senior management.</p>


<h2 class="section-title">Task</h2>
<hr>
<p>Describe your proposed product or service and how it would enhance one or more of the following Areas:
</p><ul>
<li><p>Curriculum</p></li>
<li> <p>Pedagogy</p></li>
<li><p>Assessment</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>From your selected Area(s), elaborate based on one or more of the following Themes:
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Self-directed: by developing pedagogy, tools and structures that help students develop intrinsic motivation and take ownership of their learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Personalised: by creating learing experiences that customise the pace and path that caters to each child's needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Connected: by developing collaborative learning experiences, and connect students' learning to the community and the world. </p></li>
<li>
                                 <p>Human-centred: by leveraging a data-driven understanding of how affect can help optimise learning for every child. </p>
                               </li>
