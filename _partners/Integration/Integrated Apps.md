Integrated Apps
===============

Companies or agencies can integrate their applications with the SLS via the existing [Application Development Framework (ADF)](/files/Partnerships/adpspecifications21.pdf).

ADF offers different ways and levels of integration. Once integrated, partner solutions like single sign-on and data exchange can provide a seamless teaching and learning experience for SLS users.

Integrated apps are featured in the **App Library** page within SLS and can be accessed by SLS users.

    
If you are interested to integrate your application into SLS, you may contact the [SLS Partnerships Team](https://go.gov.sg/sls-partnerships-contact) for further discussion.
