<h1 id="integrated-apps">Integrated Apps</h1>
<p>Companies or agencies can integrate their applications with the SLS via the existing <a target="_blank" href="/files/Partnerships/adpspecifications2025.pdf">Application Development Framework (ADF)</a>.</p>
<p>ADF offers different ways and levels of integration. Once integrated, partner solutions like single sign-on and data exchange can provide a seamless teaching and learning experience for SLS users.</p>
<p>Integrated apps are featured in the <strong>App Library</strong> page within SLS and can be accessed by SLS users.</p>
<p>If you are interested to integrate your application into SLS, you may contact the <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/sls-partnerships-contact">SLS Partnerships Team</a> for further discussion.</p>
