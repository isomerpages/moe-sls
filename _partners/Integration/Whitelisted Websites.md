Whitelisted Websites
====================

 Once a website has been whitelisted, it can be accessed freely by SLS users for teaching and learning purposes. It can also be embedded into a lesson as an iframe so that the lesson can flow more seamlessly.

    
If you would like to whitelist a particular website for SLS, please submit a [Website Whitelisting Form](https://go.gov.sg/sls-whitelist-form).
