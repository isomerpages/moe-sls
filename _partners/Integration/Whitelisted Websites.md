<p> Once a website has been whitelisted, it can be accessed freely by SLS users as an <strong>External Resource</strong> for teaching and learning. It can also be embedded into a lesson as an iframe so that the lesson can flow more seamlessly.</p>
<p>If you would like to whitelist a particular website for SLS, please submit a <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/sls-whitelist-form">Website Whitelisting Form</a>.</p>
