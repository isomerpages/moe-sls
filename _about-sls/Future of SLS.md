Future of SLS
=============

 The SLS is able to continually tap on the affordances of emerging technologies to remain relevant. As we move towards SLS V2, the SLS plans to integrate more user-facing apps to help supplement its core features and resources. Additionally, proprietary APIs have been built to integrate with cloud services and externally hosted engines.
