<p>As we gear up for e-assessments, here are some handy tips from the SLS
team to ensure a smooth experience,</p>

<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Check that all students are able to access SLS. Perform password resets
before e-assessment day (if needed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a passcode for students in your class group if they forget their
passwords on the day of the e-assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide invigilating teachers “Co-Teacher” rights to the class group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use SLS’s print-lite feature to print hard copies of the e-assessment
as back-up. This allows students to complete the e-assessment if they are
unable to access SLS or the e-assessment on the day of assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take photos/screenshots of students’ responses if they are unable to submit
their e-assessment, which can then be uploaded to SLS for marking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
