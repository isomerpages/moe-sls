<p>Getting ready for Home-Based Learning (HBL)? The SLS team would like to
share some reminders from the SLS Handbook to make it as seamless as possible
for all our students.</p>

<br><strong>Password Resets</strong>: Check that your students have set a
verified password reset email address in their SLS accounts. This will
enable them to reset their passwords on their own if they have trouble
logging in.</p>
<p><strong>School-Based Helpline</strong>: Set up and maintain a school-based
helpline that students can contact for assistance during school operating
hours. Remember to keep your schoolâ€™s contact details on our Info-Site
updated as well.</p>
<p><strong>SLS Helpdesk</strong>: Ensure that your students have the SLS
helpdesk contact details for assistance after school operating hours. They
would need to able to answer their own security questions.
