<h2><img src="/images/Icons/Star.svg" style="width:3rem; display: inline;">Features for All Users</h2>
<ol>
<li><details><summary><h4>Search</h4></summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Search Interface</strong>: Teachers and students can use improved filter options, including author/collaborator names, to refine their search results across multiple locations. Search results will now include a preview of the resource content referenced in the search, with search match indicators and search terms bolded in green.</li>
</ul></details></li>

<li><details><summary><h4>Assignments</h4></summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Page Navigation Anchoring</strong>: The page navigation bar is now anchored to the top, ensuring that page numbers remain visible for paginated activities or quizzes.</li>
<li><strong>Annotations on Media</strong>: Teachers and students can create annotations linked to specific timestamps in video or audio files within assignments. When an annotation is made, a pin indicator will appear on the media player. Clicking the pin will navigate users to the corresponding timestamp. These annotations can also be viewed in the transcript (if generated by the teacher), and media titles will be displayed on the annotation cards.</li>
<li><strong>Annotation Drawer Improvements:</strong> Teachers and students can view notes and annotations clustered by component in the annotation drawer. The drawer will be closed by default in assignments and modules, but users can choose to collapse or expand all annotations. For activities or quizzes with multiple pages, a pagination divider will be included in the drawer. Enhanced anchoring interactions in the annotation drawer will improve navigation between notes, annotations, and content.</li>
<li><strong>Module Loading</strong>: A refresh button has been added to the Interactive Thinking Tool (ITT), discussion boards, and aggregated student responses (teachers only) to update and display new responses, highlighted by a yellow dot.</li>
<li><strong>Tamil E-Dictionary</strong>: Teachers can enable the Tamil E-Dictionary under Module Settings. When enabled, teachers and students can retrieve definitions and audio clips with correct pronunciation of words and add selected words with definitions to their notes and annotations.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tracking Multiple Class Groups</strong>: Teachers and students can select multiple class groups to view students’ learning progress for assignments and self-study modules, as well as generate learning reports for multiple class groups. This also applies to the Adaptive Learning System (ALS).</li>
