<p>As we gear up for e-assessments, here are some handy tips from the SLS
team to ensure a smooth experience,</p>

</div>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Check that all students are able to access SLS. Perform <a href="/teacher-user-guide/administer/reset-student-passwords-for-classes/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">password resets</a> before
e-assessment day (if needed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a <a href="/teacher-user-guide/administer/generate-passcode-for-students/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">passcode</a> for
students in your class group if they forget their passwords on the day
of the e-assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide invigilating teachers “<a href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/create-class-groups/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Co-Teacher</a>”
rights to the class group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use SLS’s <a href="/teacher-user-guide/discover/view-print-friendly-worksheet/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Print-Friendly</a> feature
to print hard copies of the e-assessment as back-up. This allows students
to complete the e-assessment if they are unable to access SLS or the e-assessment
on the day of assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take photos/screenshots of students’ responses if they are unable to submit
their e-assessment, which can then be uploaded to SLS for marking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
