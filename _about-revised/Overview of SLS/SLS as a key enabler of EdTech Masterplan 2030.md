<h3>SLS V2 as a Key Enabler of the EdTech Masterplan 2030</h3>
<hr>
<p>The Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) V2 is a key enabler in supporting
schools in their implementation of the EdTech Masterplan 2030 by:</p>
<p>a. Providing tools (including AI-enabled ones) that transform T&amp;L
through greater customisation and enable users to make better data-informed
decisions.</p>
<p>b. Providing resources that develop Digital Literacy and Technological
Skills (DLTS), and 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies (21CC) and allow
students to take ownership of their own learning and develop agency; and</p>
<p>c. Supporting its use as a One-Stop Hub to enable users to enjoy synergies
and economies of scale and serve as a capability multiplier.</p>
