age, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing.</p>
<p>“We will always couple the learning of the technical use of AI with the
ethical use of AI,” he said. This includes knowing the benefits as well
as the downsides of certain AI products.</p>

<p>Mr Lim role-models positive AI use in his History lessons by highlighting
to his students the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and has
them assess response quality by cross-referencing the AI outputs with what
they’ve learnt in class. This trains their evaluation skills and sharpens
their historical understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Temasek Primary, under the guidance of their teachers, students are
taught how to write prompts to generate highly detailed images using AI
image generator Stable Diffusion for an e-book on sustainability. Students
also learn to improve their problem-solving skills when they evaluate the
effectiveness of their prompts and make adjustments as needed.</p>

<p>Mr Victor Chew, Head of the Information and Communications Technology
department at Rosyth School, said that with the Adaptive Learning System,
there was differentiation provided, which complemented self-directed learning.
This enabled teachers to have a better understanding of their pupils’ mastery
of concepts, and to adjust their lesson plans to target pupils’ learning
needs more effectively.</p>

<p>Mrs Finella Goh, principal of Lakeside Primary School, said: “What we
really like about the use of AI is that it allows the students to move
at a pace they are comfortable with.” The Adaptive Learning System allows
teachers to “meet students where they are” and adjust the pace of their
lessons to suit them, she added.</p>
