<h1>AI in SLS</h1>
<p>To enable greater customisation of learning and augment teachers’ professional
practice, MOE is developing AI-enabled features in the SLS. This supports
the Transforming Education through Technology Masterplan 2030, as well
as Singapore’s National AI Strategy announced in November 2019 for “Personalised
Education through Adaptive Learning and Assessment”.​</p>
<p></p>
<p>The development of AI-enabled features in SLS ensures that pedagogical
considerations are built into them by design, all students have equitable
access and additional guardrails are deployed for students to have a safe
learning experience.</p>
