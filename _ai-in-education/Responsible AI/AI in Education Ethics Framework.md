<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education has the potential
to further customise and personalise students’ learning, and encourage
self-directed learning. It can also augment teachers’ professional practice
by automating routine tasks and allowing teachers to spend more time with
students and provide more complex guidance to advance learning. However,
inappropriate AI use may impede the development of critical thinking skills
in students or propagate misinformation.
<br>
</p>
<p>In Singapore, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has introduced
the <a href="https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/help-and-resources/2020/01/model-ai-governance-framework" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Model AI Governance Framework</a> to
guide the responsible deployment of AI solutions. The Implementation and
Self-Assessment Guide for Organisations (ISAGO) was also created to help
organisations align their AI governance practices with the Model AI Governance
Framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>Specifically, the Ministry of Education has developed the AI-in-Education
(AIEd) Ethics Framework, which builds on the Model AI Governance Framework
to address education-specific use and risks, and incorporates key beliefs
from the Ethos of the Teaching Profession.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The MOE AIEd Ethics Framework seeks to:&nbsp;</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Guide the safe and responsible development and governance of AIEd systems
used for teaching and learning, e.g. by providing key implementation considerations
to MOE HQ personnel overseeing AIEd projects and school users deploying
and using AIEd systems; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure our AIEd practices are in alignment with our professional beliefs
as expressed in our Ethos of the Teaching Profession.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<hr>
<p>The MOE AIEd Ethics Framework outlines four principles of <strong>Agency</strong>, <strong>Inclusivity</strong>, <strong>Fairness </strong>and <strong>Safety</strong>.</p>

</div>
<h2>Agency <img src="/images/AI in Education/ResponsibleAI_AgencyIcon.png" style="width:2.5rem; display: inline;"></h2>
<hr>
<p>AIEd systems should preserve students’ and teachers’ choice and control over important personal and professional decisions. Students should be able to decide what, when or how they wish to learn, while teachers should also be able to influence AI-supported decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>How agency is practised</strong></h4>
<p>To allow our teachers to remain key in designing and facilitating learning
experiences which cater to students’ learning needs, in line with our Singapore
Curriculum Philosophy, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure a suitable level of human involvement in AI-supported decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guide teachers in exercising professional judgment on how to use AI in
an educationally meaningful manner, to allow continued opportunities for
the development of, and not diminishing critical competencies such as 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h2>Inclusivity <img src="/images/AI in Education/ResponsibleAI_InclusivityIcon.png" style="width:2.5rem; display: inline;"></h2>
<hr>
<p>We believe that every child can learn and achieve. All users, regardless
of background or abilities, should be able to reap the benefits of AIEd
systems.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>How inclusivity is practised</strong></h4>
<p>To provide opportunities for all students, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable broad access to AIEd systems for users to experience their benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the use of AIEd systems does not disadvantage any group of
students&nbsp;or deepen educational inequalities.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<h2>Fairness <img src="/images/AI in Education/ResponsibleAI_FairnessIcon.png" style="width:3.2rem; display: inline;"></h2>
<hr>
<p>AIEd systems should be free from bias<strong> </strong>and be accurate.
The use of AIEd systems should also be transparent (made known to users)
and their outputs should be explainable (users should be able to understand
why the AIEd system made a particular decision).</p>
<h4><strong>How fairness is practised</strong></h4>
<p>To equip teachers with accurate information to address students’ learning
gaps and promote positive impact on students, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avoid data bias by having sufficient representative data for training
of centrally deployed AIEd systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make users aware of the use of AIEd systems by being transparent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate the reason(s) behind decisions made by AIEd systems to users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure outputs from AIEd systems are accurate and applied within its intended
purpose and context.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safety <img src="/images/AI in Education/ResponsibleAI_SafetyIcon.png" style="width:2.5rem; display: inline;"></h2>
<hr>
<p>Learners’ interests, privacy and well-being should be protected, and measures
should be in place to ensure the safe use of AIEd systems.</p>
<h4><strong>How safety is practised</strong></h4>
<p>To fulfil our duty of care towards students and allow them to have a safe
learning environment, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure data privacy and security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have clear accountability and risk management procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid negative social and psychological effects on students and teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
