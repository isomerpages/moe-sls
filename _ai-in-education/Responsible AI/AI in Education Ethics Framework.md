<h1>AI-in-Education Ethics Framework</h1>
<p>MOE has developed the MOE AI-in-Education (AIEd) Ethics Framework to ensure&nbsp;the
safe and responsible development, governance and deployment of AI&nbsp;systems
for teaching and learning. The framework is organised around the four ethical
principles of <strong>Agency</strong>, <strong>Inclusivity</strong>, <strong>Fairness</strong> and <strong>Safety</strong>.</p>
