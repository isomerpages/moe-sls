<h1>AI Literacy</h1>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Literacy is one of the Technological Skills
highlighted in the EdTech Masterplan 2030, which refers to the ability
to understand and use specific technologies to solve problems and achieve
practical goals. As a start, through AI Literacy, we aim to equip our students
to understand what AI is, identify and explain its potential benefits,
limitations, and risks, and to be able to leverage AI tools effectively
for learning and for their daily lives.</p>
