<h1>Future of Student Learning Space</h1>
<p>The Student Learning Space (SLS) is able to continually tap on the affordances of emerging technologies to remain relevant. As we move towards SLS V2, the SLS plans to integrate more user-facing apps to help supplement its core features and resources. Additionally, proprietary APIs have been built to integrate with cloud services and externally hosted engines.</p>
