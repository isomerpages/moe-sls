<h1>About Assignment Sharing</h1>
<hr>
<p>Teachers can enable Assignment Sharing to allow you to share your Assignments
with your peers. Assignment Sharing allows you to share your Notes and
learn from each other.</p>
<p>Assignment Sharing will work for both you and your peers and cannot be
cancelled.</p>
<p>There are two ways to identify if assignment sharing is enabled:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the Assignment card, the&nbsp;<strong>Assignment Sharing</strong>&nbsp;icon&nbsp;</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Icons/SharingEnabled.svg">
</div>
<p>&nbsp;is shown next to Lesson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the assignment, click the&nbsp;<strong>User Avatar</strong>&nbsp;icon
on the top right to open the Assignment Sharing subpage. It should show
"Sharing Enabled".</p>
<p>Note: If it shows <strong>Sharing Disabled</strong>, it means that your
teacher has not enabled Assignment Sharing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From the Dec 2025 Update, shareable assignments enabled by teachers will
be automatically shared with peers on your <strong>Study Buddy List</strong> within
the same <strong>Class Group</strong>. Also, you can also by manage assignment
sharing by <strong>adding more Study Buddies</strong> [Hyperlink Manage Study
Buddy List (New)].</p>
