<h1 id="about-assignment-sharing">About Assignment Sharing</h1>
<p>Teachers can enable Assignment Sharing to allow you to share your Assignments with your peers. Assignment Sharing allows you to share your Notes and learn from each other.</p>
<p>Assignment Sharing will work for both you and your peers and cannot be cancelled. You can share your Assignment with multiple peers in your <strong>Class Group</strong>.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: Assignments that allow for Assignment Sharing are indicated by the <strong>Assignment Sharing</strong> icon <img style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/Icons/SharingEnabled
