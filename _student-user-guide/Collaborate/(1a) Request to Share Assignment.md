(1a) Request to Share Assignment
================================

1.  When your teacher has enabled Assignment Sharing, you can initiate a share request with your peers. There are three ways to identify if an assignment can be shared:
    
    *   From the Assignment Card, the **Assignment Sharing** icon \[insert icon\] is shown next to Lesson
    *   In the assignment, open the right menu. The **Share** button will be shown if enabled.
    
    Note: If the ************Share************ button is greyed out, it means that your teacher has not enabled Assignment Sharing.
    
    *   In the assignment, click the **User Avatar** icon \[insert icon\] to open the Assignment Sharing subpage. It should show "Sharing Enabled".
2.  To share an assignment:
    
    1.  Click the **Overflow** **(3-dot** icon\*\*)\*\* to open the right menu. Click **Share**.
        
    2.  Click the **User Avatar** icon followed by the **Plus** (**+** icon).

    Note: You are not allowed to withdraw the sharing request after it has been sent.
    
4.  The status will change from ”Share Request” to ”Pending Request”. This means that you are waiting for your classmate to accept your request.
