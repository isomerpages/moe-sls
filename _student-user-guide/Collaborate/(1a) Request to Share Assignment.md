<li><p>In the assignment, open the right menu. The <strong>Share</strong> button will be shown if enabled.</p>
	<p><u>Note</u>: If the <strong>Share</strong> button is greyed out, it means that your teacher has not enabled Assignment Sharing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the assignment, click the <strong>User Avatar</strong> icon to open the Assignment Sharing subpage. It should show "Sharing Enabled".</p>
