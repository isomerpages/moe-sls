<h1 id="about-class-groups">About Class Groups (Enhanced)</h1>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: From Release 2 (Nov 2024), Class Groups that are older than four years will be automatically archived and can no longer be accessed.</p>
<p>There are two types of Class Groups in SLS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Class Groups (Class) are created using subject class and teaching group information imported from the School Cockpit. Class Groups are assigned a specific colour based on the subject type e.g. green for Sciences, orange for Mathematics.</li>
<li><p>Class Groups (Group) are created by your teachers in SLS. They may be assigned a specific colour should your teacher tag it based on subject type.</p>
