  <h1>About Class Groups (new page)</h1>
  <p>There are two types of Class Groups in SLS:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Class Groups (Class) are created using subject class and teaching group information imported from School Cockpit. Class Groups are assigned a specific colour based on the subject type e.g. green for Sciences, orange for Mathematics.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Class Groups (Group) are created by your teachers in SLS. They may be assigned a specific colour should your teacher tag it based on subject type.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
