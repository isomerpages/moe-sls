<h1>About Adaptive Learning System (ALS)</h1>
<p>The Adaptive Learning System (ALS) is a feature currently available for Primary 5 Mathematics only. With the ALS, students can learn independently without depending on teachersâ€™ assignments. Students can indicate their learning goals and preferences within the system, and the ALS will provide students with topic and learning mode recommendations. </p>
