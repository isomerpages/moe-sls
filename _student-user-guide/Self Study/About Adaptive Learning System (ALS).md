<h1>About Adaptive Learning System (ALS)</h1>
<p>The Adaptive Learning System (ALS) provides a personalised learning pathway for each student, recommending learning resources and practice questions and offering immediate feedback based on his/her readiness. Students can access the ALS through the Student Learning Space (SLS) for self-directed learning. With the ALS, students learn independently, at their own pace, according to their strengths and needs. </p>
