<p>There are 3 types of Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Highlighted Annotation Notes: These are found within an Activity of an Assignment, or Self-Study Resource. They can be created by both your teacher and yourself.</li>
<li>Underlined Annotation Notes: Notes with underlines are only found in Assignments. These are created by your teachers to provide feedback or to highlight key concepts.</li>
<li>Notes: These are found within an Activity of an Assignment, or Self-Study Resource. They can be created by both your teacher and yourself. These Notes are not anchored to anywhere in the Assignment or Resource.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can access Notes from within a Lesson. Expand the Annotation Drawer by clicking the <strong>Notepad</strong> icon <img style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/Icons/Note.svg"> to find your Annotation cards. The cards will indicate the name of the person who posted it, the number of comments (if Commenting has been turned on), and a preview of the text in the notes.</p>
