<li>
<p>As Learning Assistant uses generative AI, its responses are probabilistic
in nature and may be inaccurate at times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are encouraged to always reflect on the responses received and verify
that the content generated is accurate and appropriate by fact-checking
with other sources.</p>

<p>When the Learning Assistant is enabled for interactions, you will interact
with <strong>SALiS.</strong> Click on <strong>Discuss with SALiS</strong> in
the Interactive component to begin your interaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use SALiS’s responses to guide your interaction, but always <strong>think critically and verify information</strong> before
using it in your assignments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can interact with SALiS up to a set limit determined by your teacher.
Once the limit is reached, you <strong>cannot continue</strong> the conversation
in that interaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SALiS may provide <strong>three suggested questions</strong> per interaction
to help guide the discussion. You may use these as prompts or ask your
own questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your interactions with SALiS are automatically <strong>saved</strong> in
the Interactive component, where your teacher can <strong>review your conversation history</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should ask <strong>clear and specific questions</strong> for better
responses, use SALiS’s suggestions to deepen interactions while thinking
independently, and always ensure accuracy before relying on AI-generated
content.</p>
