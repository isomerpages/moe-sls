<h1>About Adaptive Learning System (ALS)</h1>
<hr>
<p>The Adaptive Learning System (ALS) provides a personalised learning pathway
for each student, recommending learning resources and practice questions
and offering immediate feedback based on his/her readiness. Students can
access the ALS through the Student Learning Space (SLS) for self-directed
learning. With the ALS, students learn independently, at their own pace,
according to their strengths and needs.</p>
