<li>To access ALS, open the left menu from the header at the homepage and click <strong>Resources</strong>, followed by <strong>Adaptive Learning</strong>.</li>
<li>Access to Adaptive Learning is based on level and subject. Students can access ALS content below their current level of learning and one level above their current level of learning. (If you are in Primary 5, you will be able to access content tagged to Primary 6, together with content from Primary 1 to 4). 
<p><u>Note</u>: Currently, it is available for selected topics in Mathematics (Upper Primary) and Geography (Upper Secondary). It will also be made available for selected topics in Mathematics (Lower Secondary) in 2025.</p></li>

<li>When you first access the ALS, you will be presented with some questions for the system to understand your learning profile and goals.</li>

<br>
<li>You will be asked to complete the questions again at the start of each week to capture your weekly Learning Goals. These goals can be set and edited on the main Adaptive Learning page.</li>

<br><li>Every subject will be organised on a shelf. You can easily track your learning progress for a topic using the progress bar on the Topic cards.</li>

	<li>There are four learning modes in ALS.</li>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Learning mode</th><th> Choose this mode if you…</th></tr>
<tr><td>Guided Learning</td><td>feel that the topic might be challenging, and you will need guiding materials to help you as you learn step by step.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mastery Check</td><td>feel confident, have no issues in this topic, and wish to check your understanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Revision </td><td> want to revise a previously learned topic before checking your understanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Test Myself</td><td>want to test yourself on certain topics and/or sub-topics. 10, 20 or 30 questions from your current level of learning can be selected.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
	<li>After selecting a Topic / Subtopic, the learning mode best suited to your learning profile will be labelled with a ‘Recommended’ tag.  You can follow the recommendation or choose another mode. You can also exit the chosen learning mode halfway and change to a more suitable learning mode.</li>

<li>At the end of the session, you can view your learning progress and decide what topics to learn next. For more information on how to track your learning progress with ALS, click <a target="_blank" href="/student-user-guide/track-progress/view-als-learning-progress/">here</a>.</li>
