<h1>(A1) Access Adaptive Learning System (ALS) (Enhanced)</h1>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To access ALS, open the left menu from the header at the homepage and
click <strong>Resources</strong>, followed by <strong>Adaptive Learning</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to Adaptive Learning is based on level and subject. Students can
access ALS content below their current level of learning and one level
above their current level of learning. (If you are in Primary 5, you will
be able to access content tagged to Primary 6, together with content from
Primary 1 to 4).</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: Currently, it is available for selected topics in Mathematics
(Upper Primary and Lower Secondary) and Geography (Upper Secondary).</p>

<p>When you first access the ALS, you will be presented with some questions
for the system to understand your learning profile and goals.</p>

<p>You will be asked to complete the questions again at the start of each
week to capture your weekly Learning Goals. These goals can be set and
edited on the main Adaptive Learning page.</p>

<p>Every subject will be organised on a shelf. You can easily track your
learning progress for a topic using the progress bar on the Topic cards.</p>

<p>After selecting a Topic / Subtopic, the learning mode best suited to your
learning profile will be labelled with a ‘Recommended’ tag. You can follow
the recommendation or choose another mode. You can also exit the chosen
learning mode halfway and change to a more suitable learning mode.

<p>At the end of each quiz, you will be able to see your mastery level of
the concepts tested. You can also view your learning progress and decide
what topics to learn next. For more information on how to track your learning
