<ol>
<li>To access ALS, open the left menu from the header at the homepage and click <strong>Resources</strong>, followed by <strong>Adaptive Learning</strong>.</li>
<li>Access to Adaptive Learning is based on level and subject. Currently, it is available for selected topics in Mathematics (Upper Primary) and Geography (Upper Secondary). More subjects and topics will be added progressively. </li>

<br>
<li>When you first access the ALS, you will be presented with some questions for the system to understand your learning profile and goals. You will be prompted to complete the questions again at the start of each week to capture your weekly Learning Goals. </li>

<li>These goals can be set and edited on the main Adaptive Learning page.</li>

<br><li>Every subject will be organised on a shelf. You can easily track your learning progress for a topic using the progress bar on the Topic cards.</li>

<br>	
	<p>From June 2024 (R1), there will be four learning modes in ALS.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Learning mode</th><th> Which mode should you choose?</th></tr>
<tr><td>Guided Learning</td><td>Choose this mode if you feel that the topic might be challenging, and you will need guiding materials to help you as you learn step by step.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mastery Check</td><td>Choose this mode if you feel confident, have no issues in this topic, and wish to check your understanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Revision </td><td> Choose this mode if you want to revise a previously learned topic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Test Myself</td><td>Choose this mode if you want to test yourself on certain topics and/or sub-topics. </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<li>
For Guided Learning, Mastery Check and Revision mode, after selecting a Topic/Subtopic, the learning mode best suited to your learning profile will be labelled with a ‘Recommended’ tag. You can follow the recommendation or choose another mode. You can also change to a more suitable learning mode later on. </li>
<img alt="(A1) Access Adaptive Learning System (ALS)" src="/images/1Student/SS_AccessAdaptiveLearning05.png" style="width: 100%;">
<p><u>Note</u>: For Test Myself mode, up to 40 questions from your current level of learning can be selected.</p>
