<h1>(B1,1) Annotate Text within Activities (Enhanced)</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Add Annotation to Text within an Activity</h2>
<hr>
<p>When you are working on an assignment or a Self-Study resource, you can add annotations to the text. This feature can be used to make notes specific to a phrase or sentence. For example, you can insert a definition or explanation for a term you just learnt. You can also highlight text without adding a Note to it.</p>
<ol>
<li>From within a module, highlight the text that you want to annotate.</li>
<li>Select a colour for the highlight.

</li>
<li>A textbox will appear. You may choose to <strong>Highlight</strong> the text without adding a Note <img style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/Icons/Highlight.svg">, or <strong>Add a Note</strong> <img style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/Icons/Annotate.svg"> to accompany the highlighted text.</li>
<li>You may insert text, mathematical or chemical equations, emoticons, upload a background image or drawing, attach a file or add an audio recording in a Note.

<h2>E-Dictionary in Annotation</h2>
<hr>
<p>For Chinese and Tamil Assignments and Resources with the E-Dictionary enabled, you will be able to highlight text to find its meaning in the E-Dictionary.</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon selecting the <strong>E-Dictionary</strong> icon <img style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/Icons/eDict.svg">, students can view the meaning of the word (with English translation, if enabled);</li>
<li>Listen to the pronunciation;</li>
<li>Add what you have searched to the right drawer as Notes. This creates an easy point of reference to revisit the meaning of the word in future.</li>
</ol>
