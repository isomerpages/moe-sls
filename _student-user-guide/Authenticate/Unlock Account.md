<h3>Unlock Account</h3>
<h4>How a Student Account Gets Locked</h4>
<hr>
<p>For security reasons, your account will be locked if:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>you try to log in with an incorrect password too many times, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you answer the security questions incorrectly too many times when resetting
the password.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When you are unsuccessful at logging in, there will be a message to inform
you. You may continue to attempt to log in until the Login button no longer
works and you are informed you are unable to continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you do not reset your password after the Login button is greyed out
and attempt to log in repeatedly after refreshing your browser or using
a different browser or device, you run the risk of getting your account
locked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will no longer be able to log in even if you enter the correct password
and neither you nor your teacher will be able to reset your password.</p>
</li>
</ol>
