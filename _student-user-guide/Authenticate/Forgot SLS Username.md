<h3>Forgot SLS Username</h3>
<p>Your username is usually the first 5 characters of your full name and
last 4 digits of birth certificate number or NRIC together with the alphabet,
e.g. TANAH2345X.</p>
<p>Note: Usernames will not contain spaces or special characters such as
apostrophes (') and hyphens (-).</p>
<p>Alternatively, please approach your school for help. You can find out
