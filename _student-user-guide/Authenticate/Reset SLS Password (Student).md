<h3>Reset SLS Password (Student)</h3>
<p>If you have forgotten your SLS password, you can reset it by having a
password reset email sent to your email address, or by answering a series
of security questions.</p>
<h4>Reset Password with a Password Reset Link</h4>

<p><u>Note</u>: You can only do this if you have previously set a verified
password reset email address.</p>

</ul>
</li>

<h4>Did Not Receive Password Reset Email</h4>
<hr>
<p>When you use the Forgot Password feature to reset your password, an email
with a password reset link will be sent to you. If you cannot find the
email in your inbox, it may be in the spam/junk folder.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: If the link has expired, go to the login page and select <strong>Forgot Password</strong> to
request another link.</p>
<p>It is also possible that you have not entered and verified your email
address. If that's the case, you may either use the security questions
or approach a teacher to reset your password. Remember to key in an email
address after that for future password reset.</p>
<p>If the problem persists, please contact the school's SLS Administrator.</p>
<h4>Reset Password by Answering Security Questions</h4>

your password.</p>

<h4>Get Temporary Access to SLS</h4>
<hr>
<p>If you need to log in to the SLS during class and have forgotten your
password, your teacher can generate a 2-Hour Temporary Password (2HTP).
The 2HTP only allows you to access the Assignments and MOE Library. It
does not allow you to reset your password or change other details in your
Profile.</p>
<p>This is only a temporary solution. If you have forgotten your password,
you should try to reset it by following the steps above.</p>
