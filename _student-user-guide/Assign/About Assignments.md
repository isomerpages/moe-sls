<h1 id="about-assignments">About Assignments</h1>
<p>Assignments are Lessons assigned to you by your teacher. An Assignment can contain up to 20 Sections. Each section can contain up to 20 Activities or Quizzes. </p>
<p>Activities contain Text/Media, Poll, Interactive Thinking Tool or questions. Quizzes are similar but release feedback in different ways, depending on which Quiz type your teacher chooses.</p>
<p>Teachers may set Assignments as Assessments to better control assignments. In an Assessment, you cannot access non-examination material (e.g. external links) unless they have been whitelisted for use in the assessment's network. </p>
