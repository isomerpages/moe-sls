<h1>About Assignments</h1><hr>
<p>Assignments are Modules assigned to you by your teacher. An Assignment
can contain up to 20 Sections. Each section can contain up to 20 Activities
or Quizzes.</p>
<p>Activities contain Text/Media, Poll, Interactive Thinking Tool or questions.
Quizzes are similar but release feedback in different ways, depending on
which Quiz type your teacher chooses.</p>
<p>Teachers may set Assignments as Assessments to better control assignments.
In an Assessment, you cannot access non-examination material (e.g. external
links) unless they have been whitelisted for use in the assessment's network.</p>
