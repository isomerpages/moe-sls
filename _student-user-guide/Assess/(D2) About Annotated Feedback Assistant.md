<h1>(D2) About Annotated Feedback Assistant (New)</h1>
<hr>
<p>The Annotated Feedback Assistant (AFA) provides targeted in-line feedback
on both content and language through annotation cards, using suggested
answers, rubrics, and error tags to help you refine your responses. With
AFA, teachers can also use specific instructions to modulate the feedback
given (e.g. provide the correct response, hint, or probing questions) to
meet their students’ learning needs.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your teacher may add other Feedback Assistants in a Free-Response Question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may submit your response by clicking:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Submit Quiz</strong> if you are responding to a quiz;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Submit</strong> if you are responding to a standalone question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Errors detected by AFA will be reflected as annotation cards in the right
drawer, which can be displayed by clicking on the right drawer icon. To
view more details of the error, click on the comment icon of the annotation
cards.</p>

</div>
<p>Note:
<br>As AFA uses generative AI, the response is probabilistic in nature and
this results in it being inaccurate at times. You are encouraged to discuss
the&nbsp;feedback and marks with your teacher if you need further explanation.&nbsp;Bear
in mind that AFA and SAFA may have also missed some errors. If the feedback
provided is inappropriate, you may write in to <a href="mailto:helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SLS Helpdesk</a> to report the issue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Check Your Draft for Feedback (New)</h3>
<p>If your teacher has enabled it, you will see a <strong>“Check”</strong> button
after writing your response.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/StudentAFAFeedback.png">
</div>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You may check your draft to get feedback on content and language <strong>before the final submission</strong>.
This allows you to revise and improve your answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may be allowed to check your response more than once. The number of
checks left will be shown below your answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>In this example, the student has 9 checks left.</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tip: Make edits before clicking “Check” again. Submitting without improving
your answer may return similar feedback.</p>
<h3>View Feedback History (New)</h3>
<p>If your teacher allows multiple feedback drafts, you can view the feedback
from earlier drafts as well, even after your teacher unsubmits your response
for you to revise your answer. This helps you track how your response improves
over time.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/StudentAFAFeedbackHistory.png">
</div>
<p>After each check, the <strong>latest feedback</strong> will be in the annotation
card accordion in the drawer. You can continue to improve on your draft
before final submission.</p>
<p>You can also use the <strong>Past Drafts</strong> dropdown to revisit feedback
given on earlier attempts.</p>
<p>In this example:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The student sees the <strong>latest draft</strong> at the top with suggestions
(highlighted in blue or underlined).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Past Drafts</strong> dropdown lets students compare with previous
versions of their writing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
