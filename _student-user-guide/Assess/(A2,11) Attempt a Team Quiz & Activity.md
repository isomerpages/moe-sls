<h1 id="attempt-a-team-quiz-activity">(A2,11) Attempt a Team Quiz &amp; Activity</h1>
<p>Team Quizzes allow you to work collaboratively with your peers to attempt a Free-Response and/or Audio-Response Question within a Teacher-Marked Quiz.</p>
<p>Team Activities are indicated with the Team icon <img style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/Icons/Team.svg">.</p>
<p>Only one student can work on a Team question at once. The studentâ€™s work will be saved and can be viewed by other members of the team. Team members can also leave Team Annotations on Assignments.</p>
