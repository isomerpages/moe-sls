<h1>(D2) About Annotated Feedback Assistant (New!)</h1>
<hr>
<p>The Annotated Feedback Assistant (AFA) provides targeted in-line feedback
on both content and language through annotation cards, using suggested
answers, rubrics, and error tags to help you refine your responses. With
AFA, teachers can also use specific instructions to modulate the feedback
given (e.g. provide the correct response, hint, or probing questions) to
meet their studentsâ€™ learning needs.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your teacher may add other Feedback Assistants in a Free-Response Question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may submit your response by clicking:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Submit Quiz</strong> if you are responding to a quiz;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Submit</strong> if you are responding to a standalone question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Errors detected by AFA will be reflected as annotation cards in the right
drawer, which can be displayed by clicking on the right drawer icon. To
view more details of the error, click on the comment icon of the annotation
cards.</p>

<p>Note:
<br>As AFA uses generative AI, the response is probabilistic in nature and
this results in it being inaccurate at times. You are encouraged to discuss
the&nbsp;feedback and marks with your teacher if you need further explanation.&nbsp;Bear
in mind that AFA and ShortAnsFA may have also missed some errors. If the
feedback provided is inappropriate, you may write in to <a href="mailto:helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SLS Helpdesk</a> to
report the issue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
