<h1>(D2) About Language Feedback Assistant for English (Enhanced)</h1><hr>
<p>The Language Feedback Assistant for English (LangFA-EL) provides basic feedback on studentsâ€™ writing in areas such as spelling and grammar. It can also be combined with <a target="_blank" href="/student-user-guide/assess/about-short-answer-feedback-assistant/">Short Answer Feedback Assistant</a> to provide content-related feedback and suggested marks.</p>

	<li>Your teacher may add the Feedback Assistants in a Free-Response Question.</li>

			<p>As LangFA-EL and ShortAnsFA uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic in nature and this results in it being inaccurate at times. You are encouraged to discuss the&nbsp;feedback and marks with your teacher if you need further explanation.&nbsp;Bear in mind that LangFA-EL and ShortAnsFA may have also missed some errors. &nbsp;&nbsp;If the feedback provided in inappropriate, you may write in to <a href="mailto:helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com">SLS Helpdesk</a> to report the issue.
