<ol>
<li>
<p>Each user flow is labelled with an alphabet (i.e. <strong>A</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sequential steps for each user flow will be labelled with a number (i.e.
A<strong>1</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User flows with steps that are branched out will have an additional number
after a comma (i.e. A1,<strong>1</strong>).</p>

<h2>How to follow the User Flow</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On some category pages, you may see a flow chart like the one below:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Explore SLS Functions" src="/images/1Student/UG1.png">
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>These flow charts indicate the recommended steps to take (i.e. user flows)
when a user wishes to perform a particular task. You may follow the arrows
or numbering in the flow chart to proceed to the next step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A step may branch out to multiple other steps, (i.e. “Add Existing Activities
from Resources”, “Add Existing Components from Resources”, “Add Existing
Media Objects from Resources”), when there is more than one possible path
following the previous step. You may choose from any of them.</p>
