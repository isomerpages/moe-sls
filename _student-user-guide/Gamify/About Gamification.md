<p><strong>Experience Points (XP)</strong> - XP is awarded to you to measure your progress within the game. XP is converted from marks awarded from your Assignment/Assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Levels</strong> - Levels are dependent on the XP collected. When you collect enough XP, you can level up (progress to the next level).</p>
<p><strong>Game Stories</strong> - You can read about the scenario your teacher has designed for you as you progress in the Course</p>
<p><strong>Achievements</strong> - Achievements are rewards awarded to you after completing the tasks. This can come in the form of badges and trophies.</p>
