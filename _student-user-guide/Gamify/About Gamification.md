<p>Gamification allows game-based elements to be introduced in your Module. The game-based elements introduced include Experience Points (XP) and Levels, Game Stories, and Achievements. </p>
<p>You can earn bonus XP or receive lesser XP as you attempt the Module based on XP modifiers set by your teacher.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Experience Points (XP)</strong> - XP is awarded to you to measure your progress within the game. XP is converted from marks awarded from your Assignment/Assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Levels</strong> - Levels are dependent on the XP collected. When you collect enough XP, you can level up (progress to the next level).</p>
<p><strong>Game Stories</strong> - You can read about the scenario your teacher has designed for you as you progress in the lesson</p>
<p><strong>Collectibles</strong> - There are two types of Collectibles:
	</p><ul>
		<li><strong>Achievements</strong> - These are rewards awarded to you as you progress in the lesson.</li>
		<li><strong>Avatar</strong> - These are characters or items awarded to you. You may replace your SLS avatar with avatars you obtained as you progress in the lesson.</li>
		</ul>
