<h1>About Self-Study Resources (Enhanced)</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: From Release 2 (Nov 2024), Class Groups that are older than four years will be automatically archived and can no longer be accessed. Self-Study attempts from these Class Group Resources will no longer be shown in the Self-Study List.</p>
<p>Self-Study List contains a list of resources that you are attempting or have attempted for Self-Study. You can access and review these resources at your own pace. There are three ways to access Self-Study resources within SLS:</p>
<ul>
<li>MOE Library</li>
<li>Class Group Resources</li>
<li>My Drive</li>
</ul>
<p>When you attempt a Module from one of the above three locations, it will be automatically added to the Self-Study List.</p>
<h2>About MOE Library</h2>
