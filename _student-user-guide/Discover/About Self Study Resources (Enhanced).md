<h1>About Self-Study Resources</h1>
<hr>
<p>Self-Study List contains a list of resources that you are attempting or have attempted for Self-Study. You can access and review these resources at their own pace. There are three ways to access Self-Study resources within SLS:</p>
<ul>
<li>MOE Library</li>
<li>Class Group Resources</li>
<li>My Drive</li>
</ul>
<p>When a Module is attempted from one of the above three locations, it will be automatically added to the Self-Study List.</p>
<h2>About MOE Library</h2>
<hr>
<p>The MOE Library contains resources created and curated by the Ministry of Education (MOE) that complement your learning in school. You have access to Modules for all levels and subjects.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: Due to certain licensing agreements, you may be unable to load some images, audio files, videos and documents if you are not taking a subject or are accessing the SLS outside Singapore.</p>
<h2>About Class Group Resources (Enhanced)</h2>
<hr>
<p>Class Group Resources are Modules that are uploaded by your teachers to the Class Group. These modules are not assignments and do not have a due date.
