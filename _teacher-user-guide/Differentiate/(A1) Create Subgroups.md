<h2 id="about-subgroups">About Subgroups</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>Important</b>: Only class group Owners and Co-teachers are able to create Subgroups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Subgroups can be created within any class group.</li>
<li>The purpose of a Subgroup is to organise your students into smaller groups. By organising your students this way, you are able to achieve the following:<ul>
<li>assign modules to specific Subgroups</li>
<li>grant access to sections/activities for specific Subgroups</li>
<li>assign Team Activities and gamified modules to specific Subgroups</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
