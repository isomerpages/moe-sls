<li>There are two types of categories on the left menu (collapsible menu for mobile devices).<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Categories that are numbered (e.g. (i) Organise), are clusters which lead to multiple categories. </li>
<li>Categories that are not numbered e.g. Organise), are single categories which lead to the relevant user flows, i.e. questions.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-to-follow-the-user-flow">How to follow the User Flow</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><p>On some category pages, you may see a flow chart like the one below:</p>

</li>
<li><p>These flow charts indicate the recommended steps to take (i.e. user flows) when a user wishes to perform a particular task. You may follow the arrows or numbering in the flow chart to proceed to the next step. </p>
</li>
<li>A step may branch out to multiple other steps, (i.e. “Add Existing Activities from Resources”, “Add Existing Components from Resources”, “Add Existing Media Objects from Resources”),  when there is more than one possible path following the previous step. You may choose from any of them.</li>
</ol>

<li>Each user flow is labelled with an alphabet (i.e. <strong>A</strong>).</li>
<li>Sequential steps for each user flow will be labelled with a number (i.e. A<strong>1</strong>).</li>
<li><p>User flows with steps that are branched out will have an additional number after a comma (i.e. A1,<strong>1</strong>).</p>
