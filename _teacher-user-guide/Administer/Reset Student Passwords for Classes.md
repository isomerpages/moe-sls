<ol>
<li>Students who have forgotten their SLS passwords and are unable to reset them on their own</li>
<li>Onboarding a new student.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Note</u>: You cannot reset the passwords of students in your Class Groups created in SLS, but you can generate a two-hour temporary password to give them temporary access to the SLS.</p>
