<h1 id="reset-student-passwords-for-classes">(A1,ii) Reset Student Passwords for Classes</h1><hr>
<p>Owners and Co-teachers can reset the passwords of students in their Class Groups created in School Cockpit. This is necessary for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students who have forgotten their SLS passwords and are unable to reset them on their own</li>
<li>Onboarding a new student.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Note</u>: You cannot reset the passwords of students in your Class Groups created in SLS, but you can generate a <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/administer/generate-passcode-for-students/">Passcode</a> (formerly known as two-hour temporary password) to give them temporary access to the SLS.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to access the Reset Password page.</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="verification-code">Verification Code</h2>

	<p> <u>Note</u>: For security reasons, you will need to key in a verification code to verify your identity. The verification code is valid for 10 minutes. If the code has expired, you can request a new one by clicking <strong>Resend Verification Code</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Key in the verification code.</p>
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Proceed</strong>.</li>
<li>If successful, you will see a prompt indicating:<ul>
<li>the number of students whose passwords have been reset,</li>
<li>the randomly generated password which you will need to inform your student(s) and</li>
<li>the expiry date and time of this randomly generated password.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
	<p><u>Note</u>: This randomly generated password needs to be entered by the student at the SLS login page and not the MIMS login page. It will last for one year and can only be used once by each student. Upon logging in with this password, students will be asked to set a new password.</p>
