<h1 id="onboard-new-students">(A1,i) Onboard New Students</h1>
<p>Whenever new students enter the Singapore school system (e.g. Primary 1 intake, midstream entry), a new student account will be created based on information from School Cockpit. This page describes the steps to take for a teacher to assist new students to access SLS.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: Students previously from another school will already have an SLS account (e.g. Sec 1 students posted from primary schools). There is no need to onboard these students.</p>

<p>For students whose SLS account status is reflected as “Not Activated”, you will need to perform the steps above to onboard them to SLS first before they are able  to log in  via MIMS. In order to activate their accounts, students will need to enter the randomly generated password at the SLS login page and not the MIMS login page.
