<ol>
<li><p><strong>Does the Planner reflect synchronously if we update the Google/Outlook calendar?</strong></p>
<p>No. It will not be synchronised. It will be correct at the point of import.  However, we encourage teachers to use the SLS Planner directly to plan T&amp;L related activities after the initial upload, as the Planner can be used to set new events just like a Google/Outlook calendar.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Can the Planner be shared with other colleagues?</strong></p>
<p>You can create events in the Class Group. Other teachers in the Class Group will then be able to see the events on their calendar.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Can recurring events be scheduled in the Planner?</strong>
<p>Yes, teachers also have the flexibility to edit individual instances within a recurring series of events or modify the details of the entire event series.</p></li>
<li><strong>Can multple calendars be imported into the Planner?</strong>
<p>Yes, teachers can import calendars using ICS files.</p>
<p>Imported events are treated the same as manually added events directly via the SLS Planner. If the same calendar is imported multiple times, events will be duplicated.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: Importing is a one-time action for adding data, while syncing keeps data consistent between two places over time. SLS currently does not support syncing of calendar data.</p>

<li><strong>How can students manage their own Planner?</strong>
<p>Students have the capability to create and modify events in their Personal Planner, including attaching Assignments and Self-Study Tasks. However, it should be noted that events within Class Group planners are under the exclusive control of teachers.</p>
<p>For more information, visit <a target="_blank" href="/student-user-guide/plan/access-planner/">Access Planner (Student)</a>.</p></li>
<li><strong>Can the Planner identify scheduling conflicts for students when lesson assignments are set for the entire day, considering that certain teachers assign homework while others assign in-class tasks? </strong>
<p>The Planner allows students to manage their personal learning schedule and timetable. Students can create events and view Assignments which are due soon. It will not identify conflicts in lesson assignment but Assignment cards will appear under day view if there are assignments due today or in the next 3 days.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: that should there be conflicting events being scheduled, it will be reflected in the Planner, with the number of conflicted events shown for a particular time period.</p></li>
<li><strong>Can the Planner schedule be exported to personal calendars? </strong>
<p>The Planner schedule cannot be exported to personal calendars. </p></li>
