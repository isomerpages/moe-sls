<h4>F. Tech Tips for Teachers</h4>
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Can I share the URL to a particular Section (e.g. section B) with other teachers? (New in R19)</strong></p>
<p> Yes, from R19 you are able to share the URL to a particular Section with other teachers. You can also add links to Sections within your Lesson.</p>
<p> If the Lesson is in My Drive, you will need to Share the Lesson with the other teacher before the teacher can access the Section URL.</p>
<p> If you are sharing a Section URL from a Lesson in MOE Library/Community Gallery, teachers will be able to access the Section via the Section URL.</p>
<p> Note: You cannot share a Section URL from MOE Library with students. The Section URL will redirect students to the cover page of the Lesson.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How can we modify the sharing permissions of the Google files for students?</strong></p>
<p> These permissions will be automatically handled by SLS.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Once the teacher has unsubmitted a Team Quiz, can the team continue working on the same Google File? Can other teams give input?</strong> </p>
<p> Teams can continue to refine their answers in the Google File if the Team Quiz is in a Teacher-Marked Quiz. When the teacher unsubmits the Quiz, the team will be given editing permissions to the same Google File.</p>
<p> When a teacher releases a Teacher-Marked Quiz, students will no longer be able to edit the Google File. They will only be granting View-Only rights.</p>
<p> For more information, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assess/unsubmit-teacher-marked-quizzes/">Unsubmit a Teacher-Marked Quiz</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Is it possible to select a student (i.e team leader) to submit a Team Quiz response?</strong></p>
<p> For now, any student from the team can submit the Team Quiz response.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Will there be a forum feature in SLS for students to collaborate? (New in R19)</strong></p>
<p> Yes, there already is! Within each Class Group is a Forum tab for collaboration. From R19, it has been enhanced to allow teachers to create Discussion Topics and Polls. Students can also be granted permission to create Posts and Polls.  </p>
<p> For more information on Class Group Forums, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/collaborate/about-the-forum/">About the Forum</a> </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Can there be a function to share folders in My Drive to other colleagues?</strong>
<p>We discourage the sharing of large number of resources in SLS, or a single resource to a large number of users.  Please consider setting up a Staff Class Group with the users you are sharing the resources with, and upload the resources into Class Group Resources.  This allows the co-teachers in the group to download the specific resources they need directly, and work collaboratively with every other co-teacher in the Class Group on the resources (as if they were shared).</p>
</li>
<li><strong>If we want to use the Google Docs feature, do we still need to get the students to manually link their iCON in SLS?</strong>
<p>Students can link any Gmail account (including personal ones) with SLS. They only need to do it once and can subsequently access Google Apps through SLS.</p></li>
