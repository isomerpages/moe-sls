<h2>About Class Group Resources</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Class Group Resources are Lessons that are uploaded to the Class Group without assignment and do not have a due date. Teachers may use this feature to curate and share supplementary resources with students, for them to attempt on their own as self-study or meet different learner profiles.</li>
  <li>Teachers in these groups may share, co-edit and curate the resources with each other. The resources may be added from My Drive, Library (MOE Library and Community Gallery), and Starred Resources.</li>
  <li>Teachers may also create categories within Class Group Resources to better organise and filter the resources.</li>
</ol>
