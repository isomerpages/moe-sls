<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/1Student/UG1.png">
</li>
<li><p>These flow charts indicate the recommended steps to take (i.e. user flows) when a user wishes to perform a particular task. You may follow the arrows or numbering in the flow chart to proceed to the next step. </p>
</li>
<li>A step may branch out to multiple other steps, (i.e. “Add Existing Activities from Resources”, “Add Existing Components from Resources”, “Add Existing Media Objects from Resources”),  when there is more than one possible path following the previous step. You may choose from any of them.</li>
