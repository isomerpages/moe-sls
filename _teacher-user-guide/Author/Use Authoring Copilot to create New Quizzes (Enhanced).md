<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">

### Important  
- As Authoring Copilot uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic in nature. Thus, it may at times generate a different number of Sections, Activities, and Components than expected.  
- Check that the content generated by Authoring Copilot is accurate and appropriate.
