<h1>Use Authoring Copilot to create New Quizzes (Enhanced)</h1><hr>

<b>Important</b>: 
- As Authoring Copilot uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic in nature. Thus, it may at times generate a different number of Sections, Activities, and Components than expected.  
- Check that the content generated by Authoring Copilot is accurate and appropriate.

<p>Set the number of components you want, for e.g., if you want to create 3 Multiple Choice Questions and 2 Free Response Questions and, set 5 components, and select the Multiple-Choice and Free-Response options.</p>
	<p>You can also generate components directly from the component bar.</p></li>

</li>
<li><p>
In the Additional Details field, you can include information about the question types and number of questions in the Quiz.</p>
<u>Note</u>:
<ul>
<li>For example, “Create 3 multiple-choice questions with lower difficulty for students who are lower progress learners to mainly test recall. Create 2 free-response questions with higher difficulty for students who are higher progress learners to extend their learning with specific real world problems”.</li>
<li>Make sure that the information given about the number of questions in Additional Details corresponds to the Number of Components field.</li>
<li>Authoring Copilot can generate Suggested Answers for Free Response Questions.</li>
<li>You can enable <strong>ShortAnsFA</strong> and edit the Suggested Answer (if required) and mark allocation in Free-Response questions for immediate feedback.</li></ul>
</li><li>
	You can add a Knowledge Base by clicking <b>Add Knowledge Base</b>. You can upload up to 20 Knowledge Bases that can comprise text, or up to 50 images or pages of PDFs or Google files (e.g., Slides, Docs). These Knowledge Bases can be used when generating sections, activities/quizzes and components in a module. Knowledge Base Titles should be entered to organise your Knowledge Bases so that you can easily find and append the relevant Knowledge Base(s) for different activities in a module, e.g. Reading 1 for Activity 1, Chapter 2 Notes for Activity 2, etc.</li><p><img alt="Create New Quiz with Authoring Copilot" style="width: 80%;" src="/images/2Teacher/AU_ACP_KB1.png"></p>

<u>Note</u>:
<ul><li>Adding a Knowledge Base will anchor the generation of content by Authoring Copilot to information which can be added, e.g. a syllabus document, a comprehension passage or an excerpt from MOE’s interactive digital textbooks. It is recommended to upload specific PDF segments to improve the precision of generated content, as uploading too much information may potentially confuse the LLM and increase hallucinations. Please ensure all uploaded materials comply with data security classification (up to Official (Closed), Non-Sensitive) and copyright laws, using only legally permitted content, properly licensed resources, or materials with explicit permissions. You may refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/terms-of-use/">this link</a> for more details.</li></ul>

<li>Authoring Copilot will create a Suggested Quiz Plan with Quiz Description and Question(s). Click the checkbox next to Split into pages if you want the content to be populated across different pages of the Quiz. <p></p>
<p>Click the checkboxes next to the generated content you wish to include in the Quiz. Click <b>Add</b> to autogenerate the Quiz Description and Question(s) selected.</p>
