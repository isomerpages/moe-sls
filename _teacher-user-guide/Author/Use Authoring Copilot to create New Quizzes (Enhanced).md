<h1>Use Authoring Copilot to create New Quizzes (Enhanced)</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>Important</strong>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As Authoring Copilot uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic
in nature. Thus, it may at times generate a different number of Sections,
Activities, and Components than expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check that the content generated by Authoring Copilot is accurate and
appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In the Homepage, click <strong>Create/Edit</strong>, and click the <strong>orange Create</strong> icon</p>

<p>If you have used Authoring Copilot to create the Quiz, the Quiz Title
and Quiz Notes would have been pre-populated. If not, add the Quiz Title
and Quiz Notes. Quiz Notes will help guide the Authoring Copilot in the
generation of the questions in the Quiz.</p>

<p>You can select the type of components you want Authoring Copilot to generate.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Create New Quiz with Authoring Copilot" src="/images/2Teacher/AU_ACP_Components.png">
</div>
<p>Set the number of components you want, for e.g., if you want to create
3 Multiple Choice Questions and 2 Free Response Questions and, set 5 components,
and select the Multiple-Choice and Free-Response options.</p>
<p>You can also generate components directly from the component bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the Quiz Duration. This duration will be reflected at the Quiz Cover
page. The recommended duration for each generated question within the Quiz
may not add up to the total Quiz Duration set here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Additional Details field, you can include information about the
question types and number of questions in the Quiz.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For example, “Create 3 multiple-choice questions with lower difficulty
for students who are lower progress learners to mainly test recall. Create
2 free-response questions with higher difficulty for students who are higher
progress learners to extend their learning with specific real world problems”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that the information given about the number of questions in
Additional Details corresponds to the Number of Components field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authoring Copilot can generate Suggested Answers for Free Response Questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can enable <strong>SAFA</strong> and edit the Suggested Answer (if required)
and mark allocation in Free-Response questions for immediate feedback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can add a Knowledge Base by clicking <strong>Add Knowledge Base</strong>.
You can upload up to 20 Knowledge Bases that can comprise text, or up to
50 images or pages of PDFs or Google files (e.g., Slides, Docs). These
Knowledge Bases can be used when generating sections, activities/quizzes
and components in a module. Knowledge Base Titles should be entered to
organise your Knowledge Bases so that you can easily find and append the
relevant Knowledge Base(s) for different activities in a module, e.g. Reading
1 for Activity 1, Chapter 2 Notes for Activity 2, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To add PDFs or images, click Add Media, and Upload File. To add a Google
file, click on <strong>Embed File from Google</strong>, and select your
file. After uploading your file, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Note</u>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Adding a Knowledge Base will anchor the generation of content by Authoring
Copilot to information which can be added, e.g. a syllabus document, a
comprehension passage or an excerpt from MOE’s interactive digital textbooks.
It is recommended to upload specific PDF segments to improve the precision
of generated content, as uploading too much information may potentially
confuse the LLM and increase hallucinations. Please ensure all uploaded
materials comply with data security classification (up to Official (Closed),
Non-Sensitive) and copyright laws, using only legally permitted content,
properly licensed resources, or materials with explicit permissions. You
may refer to <a href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/terms-of-use/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this link</a> for
more details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authoring Copilot will create a Suggested Quiz Plan with Quiz Description
and Question(s). Click the checkbox next to Split into pages if you want
the content to be populated across different pages of the Quiz.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Click the checkboxes next to the generated content you wish to include
in the Quiz. Click <strong>Add</strong> to autogenerate the Quiz Description
and Question(s) selected.</p>
