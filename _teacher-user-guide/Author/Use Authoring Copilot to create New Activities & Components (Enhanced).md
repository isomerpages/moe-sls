<h1>Use Authoring Copilot to create New Activities &amp; Components (Enhanced)</h1>
<hr>
<u>Important:</u>
<ul>
<li>As Authoring Copilot uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic in nature. Thus, it may at times generate a different number of Sections, Activities and Components than expected.</li>
<li>Check that the content generated by Authoring Copilot is accurate and appropriate.</li></ul>
<ol><li>
In the Module Editor page of the Section, click the <b>orange Create</b> icon <img alt="create" style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/Icons/ACP.svg"> on the Section card to open Authoring Copilot.

</li>
<li>
If you have used Authoring Copilot to create the Section/ Activity, the Section/ Activity Title and Section/ Activity Notes would have been pre-populated. If you did not use Authoring Copilot to create the Section, you can add the Section/ Activity Title and Section/ Activity Notes. Add curricular considerations, which can be found in subject-specific <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opal2.moe.edu.sg/csl/s/epedagogy/wiki/page/view?title=%5BSection+1.3%5D+e-Pedagogy+in+subject+discipline">Teaching and Learning Guides</a> (requires OPAL login).&nbsp;&nbsp;

Section/ Activity Notes will help guide the Authoring Copilot in the generation of the Activities in the Section / Components in the Activities.

<li>
Click the <b>Up/Down</b> arrows to set the Number of Activities/ Quizzes/ Components to generate in the Section/ Activity. The number of Activities/ Components can depend on the number of Topics or Sub-topics covered in the Section/ Activity, or the duration you have to cover the Section/ Activity content.</li>
<u>Note</u>: A maximum of 20 Activities/ Quizzes can be created in a Section.A maximum of 100 components that can be created in an Activity.

	<li>If you have used Authoring Copilot to create the sections, Section Tags would have been pre-populated. Note that Authoring Copilot does not generate Section Tags. If you would like to add or edit Section Tags, click the dropdown arrow located on the right of the <b>Section Tag</b> field to select the Subject, Level, and Content Map. Select the checkboxes next to Topics and Sub-topics relevant to the Section.</li>
<u>Note</u>:
<ul>
<li>Section Tags help to refine the module content generated by Authoring Copilot.</li>  
<li>Sections can be tagged to Subject, Level, Topics, and Sub-topics in the MOE Content Map to improve searchability in MOE Library, Community Gallery, and My Drive in future SLS Releases.</li></ul>
<li>In the <strong>Additional Details</strong> field, you can provide specific guidance for structuring your Sections, such as directing Authoring Copilot to:
<ul>
<li>suggest technological tools or SLS features,</li>
<li>highlighting other details such as learner profile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can also use SLS templates to direct Authoring Copilot to refer to and generate. These templates help to:
<ul>
<li>specify learning experience(s),</li>
<li>sequence learning activities according to <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/guide-to-e-pedagogy/edtech-ps/learning-experiences/active-learning-processes">Active Learning Processes</a> (ALPs),</li>
<li>incorporate <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/guide-to-e-pedagogy/edtech-ps/learning-experiences/key-applications-of-technology-kat">Key Application(s) of Technology</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If no details are provided, Authoring Copilot will generate Activities and Components  based on the curriculum. For more tailored results, you can start broad and add specifics when regenerating.</p>
<li>You can add a knowledge base by clicking the checkbox next to Use Knowledge Base, followed by clicking <b>Add Knowledge Base</b>.</li>
<u>Note</u>:
<ul><li>Adding a knowledge base will anchor the generation of content by Authoring Copilot to information which can be added by teachers, e.g. a syllabus document, a comprehension passage or an excerpt from MOEâ€™s interactive digital textbooks.</li>
<li>The Knowledge Base added to the Section would appear as the Knowledge Base for activities in the Section. Teachers can enter each activity and uncheck the checkbox if they do not wish to use the Knowledge Base for that particular activity.</li> 
<li>Currently in R2 (Nov 2024), the knowledge base can only take in plain text input.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 100 000 characters can be input into this field.</li>
<img alt="Use Authoring Copilot to create New Activities &amp; Components" style="width: 80%;" src="/images/2Teacher/AU_ACPComponent14.png"></ul>
<li>Add the knowledge base into the field and click <b>Add</b>.</li>
<img alt="Use Authoring Copilot to create New Activities &amp; Components" style="width: 100%;" src="/images/2Teacher/AU_ACPComponent15.png">
<li>Review the Suggested Section/Activity Plan. Click the checkbox next to <strong>Split into pages</strong> (only for Activity Plan) if you want the content to be populated across different pages. Click <strong>Add</strong> to autogenerate the selected content.</li>
<li>You can edit the Section and Activities/ Activities and Components generated in the Module Editor page, as you would for a normal module.</li>
<li>To regenerate the Section and Activities, click <strong>Back to Generate Section</strong> to edit the Section Details and regenerate the Activities. Alternatively, you can regenerate the Section and Activities by clicking the <b>orange Regenerate</b> icon <img alt="ACP Regenerate" style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/Icons/ACPRegenerate.svg"> on the respective cards to reopen Authoring Copilot. Newly generated Activities will be appended to the end of the existing set of Activities.</li>

<li>From R2 (Nov 2024), you can regenerate any component. Click on the <b>orange Regenerate</b> icon <img alt="ACP Regenerate" style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/Icons/ACPRegenerate.svg"> on the question card, and it will show the original component. Click the <strong>Up/Down</strong> arrows to set the Number of Components and select the Component Types that you want to regenerate the original component to. Click <strong>Create.</strong></li>
<li>Authoring Copilot will show the original component and the newly regenerated component types. Click <strong>Add</strong>. Authoring Copilot will add these new components into the activity.</li>
