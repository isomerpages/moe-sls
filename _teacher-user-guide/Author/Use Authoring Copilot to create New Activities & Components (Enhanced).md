<h1>Use Authoring Copilot to create New Activities &amp; Components (Enhanced)</h1>
<hr>
<p><u>Important:</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As Authoring Copilot uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic
in nature. Thus, it may at times generate a different number of Sections,
Activities and Components than expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check that the content generated by Authoring Copilot is accurate and
appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the Homepage, click the <strong>orange Create</strong> icon</p>
<p>on any activity that you would like to generate.</p>

</div>
<p>You can also access Authoring Copilot in the Module Editor page of the
Section, and click the orange Create icon on the Section card to open Authoring
Copilot.</p>

<li>
<p>If you have used Authoring Copilot to create the Section/ Activity, the
Section/ Activity Title and Section/ Activity Notes would have been pre-populated.
If you did not use Authoring Copilot to create the Section, you can add
the Section/ Activity Title and Section/ Activity Notes. Add curricular
considerations, which can be found in subject-specific <a href="https://www.opal2.moe.edu.sg/csl/s/epedagogy/wiki/page/view?title=%5BSection+1.3%5D+e-Pedagogy+in+subject+discipline" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Teaching and Learning Guides</a> (requires
OPAL login).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section/ Activity Notes will help guide the Authoring Copilot in the generation
of the Activities in the Section / Components in the Activities.</p>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the Number of Activities/ Quizzes/ Components to generate in the Section/
Activity. The number of Activities/ Components can depend on the number
of Topics or Sub-topics covered in the Section/ Activity, or the duration
you have to cover the Section/ Activity content.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: A maximum of 20 Activities/ Quizzes can be created in a Section.
A maximum of 100 components that can be created in an Activity.</p>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the Section/ Activity Duration in the Module/ Activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have used Authoring Copilot to create the sections, Section Tags
would have been pre-populated. Note that Authoring Copilot does not generate
Section Tags. If you would like to add or edit Section Tags, click the
dropdown arrow located on the right of the <strong>Section Tag</strong> field
to select the Subject, Level, and Content Map. Select the checkboxes next
to Topics and Sub-topics relevant to the Section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Note</u>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Section Tags help to refine the module content generated by Authoring
Copilot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sections can be tagged to Subject, Level, Topics, and Sub-topics in the
MOE Content Map to improve searchability in MOE Library, Community Gallery,
and My Drive in future SLS Releases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Additional Details</strong> field, you can provide specific
guidance for structuring your Sections, such as directing Authoring Copilot
to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>suggest technological tools or SLS features,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>highlighting other details such as learner profile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also use SLS templates to direct Authoring Copilot to refer to
and generate. These templates help to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>specify learning experience(s),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sequence learning activities according to <a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/guide-to-e-pedagogy/edtech-ps/learning-experiences/active-learning-processes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Active Learning Processes</a> (ALPs),</p>
</li>
<li>

</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no details are provided, Authoring Copilot will generate Activities
and Components based on the curriculum. For more tailored results, you
can start broad and add specifics when regenerating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can add a Knowledge Base by clicking <strong>Add Knowledge Base</strong>.
You can upload up to 20 Knowledge Bases that can comprise text, PDFs or
images. These Knowledge Bases can be used when generating sections, activities/quizzes
and components in a module. Knowledge Base Titles should be entered to
organise your Knowledge Bases so that you can easily find and append the
relevant Knowledge Base(s) for different activities in a module, e.g. Reading
1 for Activity 1, Chapter 2 Notes for Activity 2, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To add PDF or images, click <strong>Add Media</strong>, and <strong>Upload File</strong>.
To add a Google file, click on <strong>Embed File from Google</strong>,
and select your file. After uploading your file, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Note</u>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Adding a Knowledge Base will anchor the generation of content by Authoring
Copilot to information which can be added, e.g. a syllabus document, a
comprehension passage or an excerpt from MOE’s interactive digital textbooks.
It is recommended to upload specific PDF segments to improve the precision
of generated content, as uploading too much information may potentially
confuse the LLM and increase hallucinations. Please ensure all uploaded
materials comply with data security classification (up to Official (Closed),
Non-Sensitive) and copyright laws, using only legally permitted content,
properly licensed resources, or materials with explicit permissions. You
may refer to <a href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/terms-of-use/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this link</a> for
more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Knowledge Base added to the Section would appear as the Knowledge
Base for activities in the Section. Teachers can enter each activity and
uncheck the checkbox if they do not wish to use the Knowledge Base for
that particular activity.</p>
<ol start="11" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Click Create to autogenerate the Activities/Components in the Module.
Review the Suggested Section/Activity Plan. Click the checkbox next to <strong>Split into pages</strong> (only
for Activity Plan) if you want the content to be populated across different
pages. Click <strong>Add</strong> to autogenerate the selected content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can edit the Section and Activities/ Activities and Components generated
in the Module Editor page, as you would for a normal module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To regenerate the Section and Activities, click <strong>Back to Generate Section</strong> to

to set the Number of Components and select the Component Types that you
want to regenerate the original component to. Click <strong>Create.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authoring Copilot will show the original component and the newly regenerated
