<p>As Learning Assistant uses generative AI, its responses are probabilistic
in nature and may be inaccurate at times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always verify that the content generated is appropriate. You may do so
by clicking on ‘Preview as Student’ to test the responses generated before
assigning the assignment to your students. You should also access students’
conversation logs when the assignment has started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, Learning Assistant is only available for Secondary 1 students
and above. When it is enabled for discussions, students will interact with <strong>SALiS</strong>.</p>

<p>Adding a Knowledge Base will anchor the generation of responses by Learning
Assistant to information which can be added by teachers, e.g. a syllabus
document, a comprehension passage or an excerpt from MOE’s interactive
digital textbooks. It is recommended to upload specific PDF segments to
improve the precision of generated content. Please ensure all uploaded
materials comply with copyright laws, using only legally permitted content,
properly licensed resources, or materials with explicit permissions. You
