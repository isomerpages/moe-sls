<li>
<p>As Learning Assistant uses generative AI, its responses are probabilistic
in nature and may be inaccurate at times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always verify that the content generated is appropriate. You may do so
by clicking on ‘Preview as Student’ to test the responses generated before
assigning the assignment to your students. You should also access students’
conversation logs when the assignment has started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, Learning Assistant is only available for Secondary 1 students
and above. When it is enabled for discussions, students will interact with
SALiS.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before using Learning Assistant or any AI-enabled features in SLS, please
ensure that your students complete the Basic Modules for AI and AI-enabled
features in SLS in the following links:</p>

<p>Adding a Knowledge Base will anchor the generation of content by Learning
Assistant to information which can be added by you, e.g. a syllabus document,
a comprehension passage or an excerpt from MOE’s interactive digital textbooks.
It is recommended to upload specific PDF segments to improve the precision
of generated content, as uploading too much information may potentially
confuse the LLM and increase hallucinations. Please ensure all uploaded
materials comply with copyright comply with data security classification
(up to Official (Closed), Non-Sensitive) and copyright laws, using only
legally permitted content, properly licensed resources, or materials with
explicit permissions.You may refer to <a href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/terms-of-use/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/terms-of-use/</a> for
