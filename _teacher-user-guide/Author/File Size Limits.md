<h1 id="file-size-limits">File Size Limits</h1>
<p>In the SLS, media objects are grouped into the following categories, each with its respective file size limits:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.notion.so/2509ebe174ab4f8c9bea03fb7bcca06f">Untitled</a></p>
<p>If the file is valid, it will be uploaded and scanned for viruses.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The virus scan may take a few seconds if the file size is large.</li>
<li>To view Augmented Reality files, a separate software may be required.</li>
<li>File names should be kept within the 50-character limit, which excludes the extension in a file path.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the file has been successfully uploaded, the media object will be added to the Lesson.</p>
