<h2 id="considerations-when-creating-a-qti-file">Considerations when creating a QTI File</h2>
<hr>
<p>When creating a QTI File for SLS, the maximum number of questions allowed in SLS is 100 questions per file. Some guidelines to uploading a QTI file include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Only QTI 2.1 files are accepted.</li>
    <li>Question requirements:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Questions stem/images</li>
            <li>Answer options (if applicable)</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>File Upload:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>A recognised QTI 2.1 zipped file from any QTI conversion tool (e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://getmarked.ai/">getmarked.ai</a> ) with no more than 100 questions.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><u>Note</u>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identifying the correct answers to Multiple-Choice Questions with single or multiple responses can be done within SLS after the questions have been uploaded.</li>
<li>You may add Hints, <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assess/add-teacher-comments/">Teacher Comments</a> and <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/author/add-question-tags/">Question Tags</a> to questions within SLS. Tagged questions will be reflected in the <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/track-progress/access-learning-progress/">Learning Progress</a> when they have been attempted by students.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Why does the QTI file fail to be accepted by SLS after uploading?</strong> </p>
<p> Ensure the version of your QTI file is QTI 2.1.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Where can I read more about QTI?</strong></p>
<p> You can read about it <a target="_blank" href="https://digitaliser.getmarked.ai/blog/complete-guide-to-qti/">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I tried downloading the zip file on my Safari browser but the file was unzipped automatically.</strong></p>
<p> Go to your Safari Preference and uncheck 'Open “safe” files after downloading'. This should allow you to download the zip file without it being automatically unzipped.</p>
