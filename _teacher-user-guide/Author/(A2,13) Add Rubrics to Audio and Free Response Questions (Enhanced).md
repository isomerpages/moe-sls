<h2>Use Rubrics Marks (Enhanced)</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The rubrics can be used as a reference but not be bound to the mark ranges
for the question. To do so, ensure that the box beside <strong>Show and use rubrics marks</strong> is
unchecked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, the marks of the rubrics can be used for the question.
To do so, check the box for <strong>Show and use rubrics marks</strong>.
The total marks will be calculated based on the marks allocated by the
teacher for each criterion in the rubrics. This will also impact students'
quiz scores in a Teacher-Marked Quiz.</p>
