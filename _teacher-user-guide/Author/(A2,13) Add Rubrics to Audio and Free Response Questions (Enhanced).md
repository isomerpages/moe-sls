<h2>Use Rubrics Marks (Enhanced)</h2>

<li>The rubrics can be used as a reference but not be bound to the mark ranges for the question. To do so, ensure that the box beside <strong>Show and use rubrics marks</strong> is unchecked.</li>
<li>Alternatively, the marks of the rubrics can be used for the question. To do so, check the box for <strong>Show and use rubrics marks</strong>. The total marks will be calculated based on the marks allocated by the teacher for each criterion in the rubrics. This will also impact students' quiz scores in a Teacher-Marked Quiz.
