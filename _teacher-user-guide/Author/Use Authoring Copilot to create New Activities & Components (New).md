<h1>Use Authoring Copilot to create New Activities &amp; Components (New)</h1>

<u>Important:</u>
<ul>
<li>As Authoring Copilot uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic in nature. Thus, it may at times generate a different number of Sections, Activities and Components than expected.</li>
	<li>Check that the content generated by Authoring Copilot is accurate and appropriate.</li></ul>

<ol><li>
In the Module Editor page of the Section, click the orange Pencil icon <img alt="pencilo" style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/Icons/pencilo.svg"> on the Section card to open Authoring Copilot.
<img alt="Use Authoring Copilot to create New Activities &amp; Components" style="width: 100%;" src="/images/2Teacher/AU_ACP_Component1.png">
</li>
<li>
If you have used Authoring Copilot to create the Section/ Activity, the Section/ Activity Title and Section/ Activity Notes would have been pre-populated. If you did not use Authoring Copilot to create the Section, you can add the Section/ Activity Title and Section/ Activity Notes. Add curricular considerations, which can be found in subject-specific <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opal2.moe.edu.sg/csl/s/epedagogy/wiki/page/view?title=%5BSection+1.3%5D+e-Pedagogy+in+subject+discipline">Teaching and Learning Guides</a> (requires OPAL login).&nbsp;&nbsp;

Section/ Activity Notes will help guide the Authoring Copilot in the generation of the Activities in the Section / Components in the Activities.

</li>
<li>
Click the <b>Up/Down</b> arrows to set the Section/ Activity Duration in the Module/ Activity.

</li>
<li>
Click the dropdown arrow located on the right of the Section Tag field to select the Subject, Level and Content Map. Select the checkboxes next to Topics and Sub-topics relevant to the Section.

<u>Note</u>:
<ul>
	<li>Section Tags help to refine the lesson content generated by Authoring Copilot to the appropriate Subject, Level, Topics and Sub-topics.</li>  
<li>Sections can be tagged to Subject, Level, Topics, and Sub-topics in the MOE Content Map to improve searchability in MOE Library, Community Gallery, and My Drive in future SLS Releases.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
In the Additional Details field, add pedagogical considerations. This can include directing the ACP to suggest technological tools or SLS features, specify learning experience(s), sequence learning activities according to <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/guide-to-e-pedagogy/edtech-ps/learning-experiences/active-learning-processes">Active Learning Processes (ALPs)</a> (requires iCON login), incorporate <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/guide-to-e-pedagogy/edtech-ps/learning-experiences/key-applications-of-technology-kat"> Key Application(s) of Technology</a> (requires iCON login), or highlighting other details such as learner profile. 

<u>Note</u>:
<ul><li>An example set of Additional Details:
<img alt="Use Authoring Copilot to create New Activities &amp; Components" style="width: 100%;" src="/images/2Teacher/AU_ACP_Component5.png">
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
Click the <b>Up/Down</b> arrows to set the Number of Activities/ Quizzes/ Components to generate in the Section/ Activity.&nbsp;

The number of Activities/ Components can depend on the number of Topics or Sub-topics covered in the Section/ Activity, or the duration you have to cover the Section/ Activity content.
<u>Note:</u>
<ul><li>A maximum of 20 Activities/ Quizzes can be created in a Section.</li>
<li>A maximum of 10 components that can be created in an Activity.</li></ul>

</li>
<li>
You can add a knowledge base by clicking the checkbox next to Use Knowledge Base, followed by clicking <b>Add Knowledge Base</b>. 

<u>Note</u>:
<ul><li>Adding a knowledge base will anchor the generation of content by Authoring Copilot to information which can be added by teachers, e.g. a syllabus document, a comprehension passage or an excerpt from MOEâ€™s interactive digital textbooks.</li>
<li>The Knowledge Base added to the Section would appear as the Knowledge Base for activities in the Section. Teachers can enter each activity and uncheck the checkbox if they do not wish to use the Knowledge Base for that particular activity.</li> 
<li>Currently in R1, the knowledge base can only take in plain text input.</li>
<li>A maximum of 30 000 characters can be input into this field.
<img alt="Use Authoring Copilot to create New Activities &amp; Components" style="width: 100%;" src="/images/2Teacher/AU_ACP_Component7a.png"></li></ul>

Add the knowledge base into the field and click <b>Add</b>.

<img alt="Use Authoring Copilot to create New Activities &amp; Components" style="width: 100%;" src="/images/2Teacher/AU_ACP_Component8.png">
</li>
<li>
Authoring Copilot will create a Suggested Section/ Activity Plan with Section/ Activity Title and Section/ Activity Notes. Click the checkbox next to Split into pages (only for Activity Plan) if you want the content to be populated across different pages of the Section/ Activity. Click the checkboxes next to the generated content you wish to include in the module. Click <b>Add</b> to autogenerate the Section and Activities/ Activity and Component(s) selected.
<img alt="Use Authoring Copilot to create New Activities &amp; Components" style="width: 100%;" src="/images/2Teacher/AU_ACP_Component9.png">
</li>
<li>
You can edit the Section and Activities/ Activities and Components generated in the Module Editor page, as you would for a normal lesson.
</li>
<li>
To regenerate the Section and Activities, click <b>Back to Generate Section</b> to edit the Section Details and regenerate the Activities. 

<u>Note</u>:
<ul>
<li>Currently in R1, components in an Activity cannot be regenerated.
<img alt="Use Authoring Copilot to create New Activities &amp; Components" style="width: 100%;" src="/images/2Teacher/AU_ACP_Component11a.png"></li></ul>

Alternatively, you can regenerate the Section and Activities by clicking the orange Pencil icon <img alt="pencilo" style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/Icons/pencilo.svg"> on the respective cards to reopen Authoring Copilot. Newly generated Activities will be appended to the end of the existing set of Activities.
