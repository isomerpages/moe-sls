<u>Important:</u>&nbsp;
*   As Authoring Copilot uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic in nature. Thus, it may at times generate a different number of Sections, Activities and Components than expected.&nbsp;
*   Check that the content generated by Authoring Copilot is accurate and appropriate.

In the Module Editor page of the Section, click the orange Pencil icon <img alt="Icon_Pencil" style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/2Teacher/Icon_Pencil.png"> on the Section card to open Authoring Copilot.

If you have used Authoring Copilot to create the Section/ Activity, the Section/ Activity Title and Section/ Activity Notes would have been pre-populated. If you did not use Authoring Copilot to create the Section, you can add the Section/ Activity Title and Section/ Activity Notes. Add curricular considerations, which can be found in subject-specific <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opal2.moe.edu.sg/csl/s/epedagogy/wiki/page/view?title=%5BSection+1.3%5D+e-Pedagogy+in+subject+discipline">Teaching and Learning Guides</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Section/ Activity Notes will help guide the Authoring Copilot in the generation of the Activities in the Section / Components in the Activities.
