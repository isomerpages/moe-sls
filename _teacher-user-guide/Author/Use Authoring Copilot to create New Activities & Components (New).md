<u>Important:</u>&nbsp;
*   As Authoring Copilot uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic in nature. Thus, it may at times generate a different number of Sections, Activities and Components than expected.&nbsp;
*   Check that the content generated by Authoring Copilot is accurate and appropriate.

In the Module Editor page of the Section, click the orange Pencil icon <img alt="Icon_Pencil" style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/2Teacher/Icon_Pencil.png"> on the Section card to open Authoring Copilot.

If you have used Authoring Copilot to create the Section/ Activity, the Section/ Activity Title and Section/ Activity Notes would have been pre-populated. If you did not use Authoring Copilot to create the Section, you can add the Section/ Activity Title and Section/ Activity Notes. Add curricular considerations, which can be found in subject-specific <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opal2.moe.edu.sg/csl/s/epedagogy/wiki/page/view?title=%5BSection+1.3%5D+e-Pedagogy+in+subject+discipline">Teaching and Learning Guides</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Section/ Activity Notes will help guide the Authoring Copilot in the generation of the Activities in the Section / Components in the Activities.

Click the dropdown arrow located on the right of the Section Tag field to select the Subject, Level and Content Map. Select the checkboxes next to Topics and Sub-topics relevant to the Section.  

<u>Note:</u>
*  Section Tags help to refine the lesson content generated by Authoring Copilot to the appropriate Subject, Level, Topics and Sub-topics.  
* Sections can be tagged to Subject, Level, Topics, and Sub-topics in the MOE Content Map to improve searchability in MOE Library, Community Gallery, and My Drive in future SLS Releases.

In the Additional Details field, add pedagogical considerations. This can include directing the ACP to suggest technological tools or SLS features, specify learning experience(s), sequence learning activities according to <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/guide-to-e-pedagogy/edtech-ps/learning-experiences/active-learning-processes">Active Learning Processes (ALPs)</a>, incorporate <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/guide-to-e-pedagogy/edtech-ps/learning-experiences/key-applications-of-technology-kat"> Key Application(s) of Technology</a>, or highlighting other details such as learner profile.

Click the <b>Up/Down</b> arrows to set the Number of Activities/ Quizzes/ Components to generate in the Section/ Activity.&nbsp;

The number of Activities/ Components can depend on the number of Topics or Sub-topics covered in the Section/ Activity, or the duration you have to cover the Section/ Activity content.&nbsp;

<u>Note:
*   A maximum of 20 Activities/ Quizzes can be created in a Section.&nbsp;
*   A maximum of 10 components that can be created in an Activity.</u>
