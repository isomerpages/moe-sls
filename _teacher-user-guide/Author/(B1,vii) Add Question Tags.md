<h1>(B1,vii) Add Question Tags</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Section Tags will be automatically added to
newly created components.</p>
<p>Most components can be tagged to Subject, Level, Content Map, Skill Level,
Topics, and Sub-topics so as to improve searchability in Community Gallery,
MOE Library, and My Drive.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: Text/Media, ITT, Poll and Discussion cannot be tagged.</p>
<p>To include a question in Learning Progress, you have to tag a question
before selecting the <strong>Include in Learning Progress</strong> checkbox.
Tagging a question will allow you to view the Learning Progress of students.
