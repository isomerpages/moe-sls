<hr>
<p>Before using third-party materials obtained from websites, it is important to check whether:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>You can abide by the terms of use for these works.</strong></p>
<p> If you are not sure whether your proposed use of the resources complies to the terms of use, it is best to contact the website for clarification e.g. If you edit a photo with a Creative Commons Share-Alike licence, the licence requires you to share this edited version freely.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The website itself is credible.</strong></p>
<p> If the website looks dubious, the materials uploaded onto that site may not be “free” as claimed. Using or disseminating materials found on these websites may result in infringement.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The content (article, photo, video, music, etc.) itself is provided legitimately.</strong></p>
<p> While the website may be legitimate, the content available for use may not be. For example, there are many infringing videos on YouTube. Sharing such videos may constitute copyright infringement.</p>
<p> This is a list of websites with no / minimal requirements for use of third-party materials, as most of these are either public domain materials or licensed under Creative Commons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Videos/ Audios/ Photos</strong></p>
<p>  <a target="_blank" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</a></p>
<p>  Wikimedia commons has a vast source of photos, video and audio files made available to the public. Difference licences (e.g. Creative Commons) may govern these materials and before using any of them, officers should make sure to check whether these materials are in public domain, and if they are not, the terms of the licence.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Photos</strong></p>
<p>  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rgbstock.com/">http://www.rgbstock.com/</a></p>
<p>  Different users contribute to the photographs on this website. Please read through the licence agreement and ensure compliance with the licence and terms of use.</p>
<p>  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imagebase.net/">http://www.imagebase.net/</a></p>
<p>  Photos are free for commercial and personal use. Please read through the licence agreement and ensure compliance with the terms of use.</p>
<p>  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/">http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/</a></p>
<p>  Photos are free for commercial and personal use. Free photos are mostly of low resolution; payment will have to be made for photos of high resolution.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Videos/ Audios</strong></p>
<p>  <a target="_blank" href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">http://freemusicarchive.org/</a></p>
<p>  The Free Music Archive offers free downloads of audio and video materials under Creative Commons (CC) and other licences.

<p>  This website, by ArtisTech Media, is a website with various audio materials. All of the materials are licensed under the CC licences. You would have to comply with the terms set out by the Creative Commons licence. Please refer to their license overview.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ebooks</strong></p>
<p>  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">https://www.gutenberg.org</a></p>
<p>  These books are free in the USA because their copyright has expired. They may not be free of copyright in other countries – and users must check whether copyright to these books has also expired in Singapore.</p>
