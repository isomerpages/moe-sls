</li>
<li><p>If the file is valid, it will be uploaded and scanned for viruses.</p>
<p> Note: The virus scan will take longer if the file size is large.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the file is successfully uploaded, the QTI questions will be added to the Lesson or Course. Each question in your zip folder will appear as a standalone question within the Activity.</p>
</li>
<li>Should there be an error message indicating “processing partially unsuccessful”, you may have to manually make some edits to the question. </li>

<hr>
<p>When creating a QTI File for SLS, the maximum number of questions allowed in SLS is 100 questions per file. Some guidelines to uploading a QTI file include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only QTI 2.1 files are accepted.</li>
<li>Question requirements: <ol>
<li>Questions stem/images </li>
<li>Answer options (if applicable)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>File Upload:<ol>
<li>A recognised QTI 2.1 zipped file from any QTI conversion tool (e.g. <a href="https://getmarked.ai/">https://getmarked.ai/</a> ) with no more than 100 questions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identifying the correct answers to Multiple-Choice Questions with single or multiple responses can be done within SLS after the questions have been uploaded.</li>
<li>You may add Hints, Teacher Feedback and Question Tags (hyperlink <a href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/sls/teachers/user-guide/vle/teacher/LessonManagement/TagComponent.html">https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/sls/teachers/user-guide/vle/teacher/LessonManagement/TagComponent.html</a>) to questions within SLS. Tagged questions will be reflected in the Learning Progress (hyperlink <a href="https://www.preprd.sls.ufinity.com/sls/teachers/user-guide/vle/teacher/LearningProgress/About.html">teachers/user-guide/vle/teacher/LearningProgress/About.html</a>) when they have been attempted by students.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Why does the QTI file fail to be accepted by SLS after <del>being</del> uploading <del>to SLS</del>?</strong> </p>
<p> Ensure the version of your QTI file is QTI 2.1 </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Where can I read more about QTI?</strong></p>
<p> You can check out <a href="https://digitaliser.getmarked.ai/blog/complete-guide-to-qti/">https://digitaliser.getmarked.ai/blog/complete-guide-to-qti/</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I tried downloading the zip file on my Safari browser but the file was unzipped automatically.</strong></p>
<p> Go to your Safari Preference and uncheck “Open “safe” files after downloading”. This should allow you to download the zip file without it being automatically unzipped.</p>
