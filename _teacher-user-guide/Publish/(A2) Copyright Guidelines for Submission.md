<li><strong>What materials can I use in my module?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can use materials created by yourself or adapt materials from MOE Library and Community Gallery. You can also use materials that are free to access from the internet so long as they are not under a paid subscription or only available for a limited period that cannot be renewed or extended (e.g. a one-time trial subscription). Note that <strong>all materials must be acknowledged</strong>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>How do I acknowledge materials that are used in my module?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>To acknowledge materials, please put the Author, Title/Website name, URL address (if any) and Date accessed below each material. E.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Source of text, Alvin Pang, What Gives Us Our Names, accessed 15 Jan 2023</em></li>
<li><em>Source of image, Open Educational Resources, </em><a href="https://iwant2study.org/ospsg/"><em>https://iwant2study.org/ospsg/</em></a><em>, accessed 5 Mar 2023</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If all the materials used are from the same website, you can put the acknowledgement on the Module Cover instead. E.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Source of all videos used, Open Educational Resources, </em><a href="https://iwant2study.org/ospsg/"><em>https://iwant2study.org/ospsg/</em></a><em>, accessed 25 Apr 2023</em></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Do materials generated by AI need to be acknowledged?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, even if they were used under a paid subscription, you should acknowledge them. E.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Source of AI generated Image/Video, ChatGPT, </em><a href="https://chatgpt.com/"><em>https://chatgpt.com/</em></a><em>, accessed 5 Mar 2023</em></li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>What are some things to look out for when uploading Media (e.g. Images/Videos/Audio) that is AI-generated?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Avoid creating new materials that are similar to existing copyrighted ones. E.g. Pokemon, Harry Potter; If they already exist, you should use existing materials that are <strong>free to access</strong> from the internet. You may search for existing materials by doing a reverse image search  (<a href="https://www.duplichecker.com/reverse-image-search.php">https://www.duplichecker.com/reverse-image-search.php</a>)</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Do I need to acknowledge all materials in my lesson, including my own?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, it is necessary to acknowledge even your own materials. In the event that someone else decides to adapt your materials, they will need to acknowledge you.</p>
<p>To acknowledge your own materials, you can put your Name and Date created. E.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Source of Featured Image/Video, Ms Alisya Yeo, 5 Mar 2023</em></li>
</ul>
<p>An exception is made for:</p>
<ul>
<li>MOE Library Resources that have the copyright information embedded in the media object.</li>
<img alt="Copyright Guidelines for Submission" style="width: 80%;" src="/images/2Teacher/P_CG2.png">
<li>Embedded Youtube videos or other websites as users can access the original link by clicking on them directly.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>What if I need to use materials that are copyrighted and not free to access from the internet?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If there is a need to do so, kindly write in to the copyright owner and obtain a licence or permission to do so. You may refer to the <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/author/copyright-resources/">Email Template for Copyright Clearance</a> for how to do so.</p>
