<ol>
<li><strong>Marks to XP Conversion</strong> - This converts marks awarded to students in standalone questions and quizzes into XP. The higher the Marks to XP conversion, the easier it is for students to level up. The default Marks to XP conversion is 1 mark to 50 XP.</li>
<li><strong>XP Modifiers</strong> - There are three ways to differentiate XP received by students to encourage positive behaviour. These modifiers only affect the XP awarded, not the awarded marks on the Heatmap.</li>
<li><p>Early submission of Quizzes - The student receives a bonus for the entire Quiz if the Quiz is submitted early. The default bonus set for early submission is 50% and the default number of days to be considered an Early Submission is 1 day before the Section Due Date.</p>
<p>  Calculation of XP awarded: (1 <strong>+</strong> percentage/100) x Awarded Marks x Marks to XP Conversion</p>
</li>
<li><p>Late submission of Quizzes - The student receives reduced XP for the entire Quiz if the Quiz is submitted late. The default bonus set for late submission is -50%.</p>
<p>  Calculation of XP awarded: (1 <strong>-</strong> percentage/100) x Awarded Marks x Marks to XP Conversion</p>
</li>
<li><p>Retries for questions - Standalone questions and questions in Progressive Quiz can be given multiple tries. Students who get the questions right on their first try will be given the full XP while students who get the questions right on subsequent tries will get a reduced XP.</p>
<p>  Calculation of XP awarded: (1 <strong>-</strong> percentage/100)^(number of retries) x Awarded Marks x Marks to XP Conversion</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><p>In the <strong>XP and Level</strong> tab, under Level Progression Settings, you may fill in the following details:</p>
<p> a. <strong>Base XP</strong> and <strong>XP Increment Per Level</strong> - This determines how XP to Next Level will be changed over different levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Base XP is the number of XP required for students to get from Level 1 (Base Level) to Level 2 (Next Level).</li>
<li><p>XP Increment Per Level is the difference in XP requirements to Next Level from the previous level. This causes the XP required to Next Level to increase as the level of the student gets higher.</p>
<p>  Calculation for XP required to Next Level = Base XP + (Current Level - 1) x XP Increment per Level</p>
</li>
</ul>
