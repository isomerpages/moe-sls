<h1>About Gamification</h1>
<hr>
<p>Gamification allows game-based elements to be introduced in your Module.
The game-based elements include Experience Points (XP) and Levels, Game
Stories, and Collectibles.</p>
<p>You can award students with bonus XP or lesser XP using XP modifiers.</p>
<p>Through the use of Game Stories, you can also create scenarios such as
Escape Room or Mystery Solving based on real world or fantasy settings.</p>
<h2>Glossary of Terms</h2>
<hr>
<p><strong>Experience Points (XP)</strong> - XP is awarded to students to
measure their progress within the game. XP is converted from marks awarded
to them in Assignments/Assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Levels</strong> - Levels are dependent on the XP collected. When
students collect enough XP, they can level up (progress to the next level).</p>
<p><strong>Game Stories</strong> - Game Stories can be used to drive the narrative
of a story and character development as the Module progresses.</p>
<p><strong>Collectibles</strong> - There are three types of Collectibles:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

module progresses.</p>

Your students can replace their SLS Avatar within the Module with these
avatars.</p>

and teachers’ profile for completing self-study modules from MOE Library.
