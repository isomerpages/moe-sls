<h1 id="about-gamification-and-leaderboard">About Gamification and Leaderboard</h1>
<p>Gamification allows game-based elements to be introduced in your Lesson. The game-based elements include Experience Points (XP) and Levels, Game Stories, and Achievements. </p>
<p>You can award students with bonus XP for early submission of Assignments and penalise them by awarding lesser XP for late submission and question retries. </p>
<p>Through the use of Game Stories, you can also create scenarios such as Escape Room or Mystery Solving based on real world or fantasy settings.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Experience Points (XP)</strong> - XP is awarded to students to measure their progress within the game. XP is converted from marks awarded to them in Assignments/Assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Levels</strong> - Levels are dependent on the XP collected. When students collect enough XP, they can level up (progress to the next level).</p>
<p><strong>Game Stories</strong> - Game Stories can be used to drive the narrative of a story and character development as the Lesson progresses.</p>
<p><strong>Achievements</strong> - Achievements are rewards awarded to students after completing the tasks. This can come in the form of badges and trophies.</p>
