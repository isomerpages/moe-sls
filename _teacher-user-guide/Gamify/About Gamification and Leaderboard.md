<h1 id="about-gamification-and-leaderboard">About Gamification and Leaderboard</h1>
<p>Gamification allows game-based elements to be introduced in your Module. The game-based elements include Experience Points (XP) and Levels, Game Stories, and Collectibles. </p>
<p>You can award students with bonus XP or lesser XP using XP modifiers.</p>
<p>Through the use of Game Stories, you can also create scenarios such as Escape Room or Mystery Solving based on real world or fantasy settings.</p>
<h2 id="glossary-of-terms">Glossary of Terms</h2>
<hr>
<p><strong>Experience Points (XP)</strong> - XP is awarded to students to measure their progress within the game. XP is converted from marks awarded to them in Assignments/Assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Levels</strong> - Levels are dependent on the XP collected. When students collect enough XP, they can level up (progress to the next level).</p>
<p><strong>Game Stories</strong> - Game Stories can be used to drive the narrative of a story and character development as the Module progresses.</p>
<p><strong>Collectibles</strong> - There are two types of Collectibles:</p>
<ul><li>Achievement - Achievements can be used to reward your students as the lesson progresses.</li>
	<li>Avatar - Avatars can be characters or items awarded to your students. Your students can replace their SLS Avatar within the Module with these avatars.</li>
</ul>
