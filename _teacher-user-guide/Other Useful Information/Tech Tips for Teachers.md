<li><strong>I can’t download student marks and responses in Heatmap. When I click on the incoming notification that the download is ready (this can take up to 10 to 15 minutes), nothing happens.</strong></li>
<li><p><strong>When I click to download a zipped resource, nothing happens.</strong></p>
<p> For Q1 and Q2, you will need to ensure that your browser settings for the SLS site is set to “enable pop-ups” by going to Settings -&gt; Privacy and Security -&gt; Site Settings. This is a known issue for Chrome and Safari browsers.</p>
<p> For more information, download the <a target="_blank" href="/files/Userguide/Downloadable%20Resources/Enable-Pop-ups-Guide.pdf">"Enable Pop-up" Guide</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I am not able to extract zipped files (e.g. student responses) that I have downloaded from SLS because of the length of the file names.</strong></p>
<p> Try shortening the name of the zip file and also extracting it into the root drive (e.g. “D:/”).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Can a teacher provide feedback/mass feedback to questions in quizzes that are not Teacher-Marked Quizzes?</strong></p>
<p> Yes, teachers are able to provide feedback to multiple students for a Free-Response, Audio-Response, and File-Submission question within an Activity, or a Quiz.</p>
<p> For more information, visit Add Teacher’s Feedback.</p>
<p> When you set any quiz as a Team Quiz, all members of the same Activity Team will also receive the same feedback.</p>
<p> For more information, visit Create Teams.</p>
<p> However, teachers can award marks to multiple students for such question types in a Teacher-Marked Quiz only.</p>
<p> For more information, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assess/mark-teacher-marked-quizzes/">Mark a Teacher-Marked Quiz</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What are the affordances for teachers with Google Integration in SLS?</strong></p>
<p> With Google Integration, teachers can seamlessly embed existing teaching resources into SLS, which will be pre-populated for individual students. Marking and providing feedback can be easily done through SLS as well. To view the overall class progress and submission, teachers may do so from the Monitor Assignment page. Marking of Google Files will have to be done individually. </p>
<p> For more information on Google Integration, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/collaborate/attach-google-files/">About Google Integration</a>.</p>
<p> For more information on marking on Google Files, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assess/mark-google-attached-files/">Mark Google-Attached Files</a>.</p>
<p> For more information on monitoring your students’ Assignment, visit Monitor Students’ Responses in an Assignment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Can students retrieve their work on Google Apps easily if done in SLS?</strong></p>
<p> Yes, they can open their work directly from the Assignment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Does SLS have an exam/test mode?</strong></p>
<p>SLS has a range of features that support assessment. One of them is the 
<a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assess/set-assignments-as-assessments/">“Assessment” feature</a>
	 that can be used on SSOE2 ACAD device with ITD lock down mode.</p>

<li><p><strong>How do I recover a missing Assignment? (New in R19)</strong></p>
<p> If you are unable to find an Assignment, it may have been deleted accidentally by yourself, or by one of the co-teachers in the Class Group.</p>
<p> Deleted Assignments cannot be recovered. To avoid accidental deletion, please read the warning prompt before clicking <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p> To prevent co-teachers from accidentally deleting an Assignment, you may wish to change their role to “Observer” or “Liaison Teacher”.</p>
<p> For more information on deleting an Assignment, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assign/delete-assignments/">Delete an Assignment</a>.</p>
<p> For more information on the roles within a Class Group, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/create-class-groups/">Create a Class Group</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Why is there a 100-assignee limit for each Assignment?</strong></p>
<p> There is no limit to the number of users you can add to a Class Group. However, when an Assignment is assigned to a Class Group with more than 100 students, there will be 1 Assignment Card, for every 100 students or part thereof.</p>
<p> This would make the monitoring of Assignments easier and allow the system to load more efficiently without having to fetch a large amount of data per Assignment.</p>

<li><p><strong>How do I copy a Rubric to use in another question?</strong></p>
<p> You cannot copy a rubric directly but you can add the question with rubrics from Add Existing questions from Library. You might wish to add a unique keyword in the keyword tags of the question (e.g. 01rubric) so that it is easy to search when you Add Questions from Library or Questions from Starred Resources during Lesson design.</p>
<p> Tip: Star the question with rubrics so that you can easily add it to your Lesson</p>
<p> For more information, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/discover/add-existing-components-from-resources/">Add Existing Components from Resources</a> or <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/star-resources/">Star Resources</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>If an existing Activity from the MOE Library is added to a Lesson, will the Lesson be automatically updated if the Activity has been updated in MOE Library?</strong></p>
<p> No, the newly created Lesson is considered a separate Lesson. However, if the student accesses the MOE Library Lesson directly, he/she will receive a banner notification indicating that there is an updated version of the Lesson.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How do I easily add superscript and subscript in the Rich Text Editor?</strong></p>
<p> The best way is to use the handwriting tool in the new equation (WIRIS) editor, which can be accessed by clicking the icon that looks like a “C” and subsequently clicking on the handwriting bar on the right of the subpage that pops up. As you write, you can confirm that the editor is reading your handwriting correctly by checking the bottom right of the editor. The Equation Editor will be enhanced in R16 (Dec 2021) to make old equations copyable and editable.</p>
<p> For more information, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/author/insert-mathematical-or-chemical-equations/">Insert Mathematical or Chemical Equation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What type of Activities will allow my students to have multiple attempts?</strong></p>
<p> For Quizzes, you can only return a Teacher-Marked Quiz to students for them to Reattempt after you have marked it.</p>
<p> For non-quizzes, most Components will allow for multiple attempts. You can adjust the number of attempts for a Component by editing the <strong>Number of Tries</strong> found at the bottom. If a student has submitted an incorrect answer, they will be prompted to <strong>Try Again</strong>. Components that do not allow for multiple attempts include Interactive Thinking Tool, Poll, Free-Response Question, Audio-Response Question, File-Submission Question.</p>
<p> Students have the option of saving their responses as drafts by clicking the <strong>Save as Draft</strong> button. Their responses will be saved and they will be able to resume their work. This is possible for all component types except for Interactive Thinking Tool and Poll.</p>
<p> For more information on the types of Quizzes, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/author/add-existing-from-library-and-starred-resources/">Add Activity from Library and Starred Resources</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>When embedding Google Files into SLS, will the original Google File be edited/changed?</strong></p>
<p> The original Google Files will not be edited as a copy of the file will be stored in SLS.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>For SLS Google Integration, where will the files be stored, and will they count towards our storage limits?</strong></p>
<p> Google Files will be stored on SLS and will not count towards Google Drive storage limits.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>For the QTI feature, the suggested website for converting the files requires a paid subscription after 2 trials. Is there a free version?</strong>
We understand the limitations with the trial account and encourage you to check with your school if there is budget to apply for a paid subscription account.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Can I share the URL to a particular Section (e.g. section B) with other teachers? (New in R19)</strong></p>
<p> Yes, from R19 you are able to share the URL to a particular Section with other teachers. You can also add links to Sections within your Lesson.</p>
<p> If the Lesson is in My Drive, you will need to Share the Lesson with the other teacher before the teacher can access the Section URL.</p>
<p> If you are sharing a Section URL from a Lesson in MOE Library/Community Gallery, teachers will be able to access the Section via the Section URL.</p>
<p> Note: You cannot share a Section URL from MOE Library with students. The Section URL will redirect students to the cover page of the Lesson.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How can we modify the sharing permissions of the Google files for students?</strong></p>
<p> These permissions will be automatically handled by SLS.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Once the teacher has unsubmitted a Team Quiz, can the team continue working on the same Google File? Can other teams give input?</strong> </p>
<p> Teams can continue to refine their answers in the Google File if the Team Quiz is in a Teacher-Marked Quiz. When the teacher unsubmits the Quiz, the team will be given editing permissions to the same Google File.</p>
<p> When a teacher releases a Teacher-Marked Quiz, students will no longer be able to edit the Google File. They will only be granting View-Only rights.</p>
<p> For more information, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assess/unsubmit-teacher-marked-quizzes/">Unsubmit a Teacher-Marked Quiz</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Is it possible to select a student (i.e team leader) to submit a Team Quiz response?</strong></p>
<p> For now, any student from the team can submit the Team Quiz response.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Will there be a forum feature in SLS for students to collaborate? (New in R19)</strong></p>
<p> Yes, there already is! Within each Class Group is a Forum tab for collaboration. From R19, it has been enhanced to allow teachers to create Discussion Topics and Polls. Students can also be granted permission to create Posts and Polls.  </p>
<p> For more information on Class Group Forums, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/collaborate/about-the-forum/">About the Forum</a> </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Can there be a function to share folders in My Drive to other colleagues?</strong>
We discourage the sharing of large number of resources in SLS, or a single resource to a large number of users.  Please consider setting up a Staff Class Group with the users you are sharing the resources with, and upload the resources into Class Group Resources.  This allows the co-teachers in the group to download the specific resources they need directly, and work collaboratively with every other co-teacher in the Class Group on the resources (as if they were shared).</p>
</li>
<li><strong>If we want to use the Google Docs feature, do we still need to get the students to manually link their iCON in SLS?</strong>
Students can link any Gmail account (including personal ones) with SLS. They only need to do it once and can subsequently access Google Apps through SLS.</li>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Must students link their iCON accounts with SLS?</strong></p>
<p> SLS will work with any Google account. However, we recommend students link their student iCON accounts to ensure seamless learning.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>If we link to our personal email, is it still possible to still store students' work in Google classroom?</strong></p>
<p> The students’ work will be stored on SLS and not on Google Classroom.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Can we link more than one Google account?</strong></p>
<p> Only one Google account can be linked at a time.</p>
</li>

<li><p><strong>I tried to embed a website using the embed code/URL but SLS does not allow me to.</strong></p>
<p> If a website has not been whitelisted, you will not be able to embed the site in SLS. An alternative would be to insert a link in the Rich Text Editor by clicking <strong>Insert/edit link</strong> (<strong>Chain</strong> icon). You have the option to decide whether the link will be opened in a new window or the current window. When students click on the link, they will be redirected accordingly.</p>
<p> For more information, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/discover/embed-whitelisted-websites/">Whitelisted Websites for Embedding</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The YouTube videos in my Lessons are not accessible.</strong></p>
<p> This could be due to a variety of reasons. First check that the video has not been taken down by YouTube by trying to access the video link outside SLS. Secondly, if the device is a student Personal Learning Device (PLD) with a Device Management Application (DMA), it could be blocked by the DMA. You will know this is the case if the student can access the Youtube video on his/her phone. In this case, ask your DMA vendor to whitelist the video. Thirdly, if the YouTube video is only inaccessible on the school network, then it is likely that the video is not whitelisted on SSN. You may wish to approach your network administrator for help.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Are there likely to be future collaborations with other Apps (e.g Nearpod, Microsoft)?</strong></p>
<p> For now, only Google has been integrated with SLS. However, the team is exploring other possible integrations. Should you wish to request for an app, kindly write to helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Is Kami whitelisted and approved to install/add on in all school laptops?</strong></p>
<p> Yes, Kami has been whitelisted for SSOE devices. Should you face any issues installing it on your SSOE device, please approach your school IT administrator or HOD ICT.</p>

<li><p><strong>How do I control student access to Activities/Sections in Assignments?</strong></p>
<p> Before you assign the Lesson, you may click the <strong>Edit</strong> icon on the Assignment Card (<strong>Pencil</strong> icon on the top right of the Card) and select the <strong>Activity Assignment</strong> tab. If you have assigned the Lesson, enter the Assignment and open the right menu. Select <strong>Manage Assignment Settings</strong> followed by the <strong>Activity Assignment</strong> tab. Toggle the access on/off to for access rights.</p>
<p> You are also able to toggle the access to the Sections and Activities by clicking from the <strong>Lesson Plan</strong>.</p>
<p> For more information, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/enact/change-access-to-activities/">Change Access to Activities</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Why do I have to enter an ITT or Discussion Card to view Comments?</strong></p>
<p> ITT and Discussion Cards have been enlarged to allow teachers and students to view more of the body message (especially when there is a Media Object attached). As such, Comments are placed within Cards, reducing the amount of text shown on the screen which helps ensure a pleasant user experience.</p>

<li><p><strong>Will form teachers be given a class with their form classes on SLS? Right now, form teachers who do not teach the whole class have to form their own teaching groups in order to conduct FTGP lessons.</strong></p>
<p> Schools are advised to create a class in School Cockpit (containing the form class students and teacher) and tag the class to a school-based subject, e.g. CCE. Once tagged to a subject, the form classes will appear in SLS.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Currently only teachers in the same Teaching Group can change password for students. Can SLS allow teachers to change a students’ password even if no TG is set up?</strong></p>
<p>We note the request and will be looking to add this capability by Dec 2023.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How will edits in School Cockpit (SC) and in SLS Class Groups affect each other?</strong></p>
<p>Information will sync only one way from SC to SLS. Updates in SC will appear in SLS. However, edits in SLS Class Groups will not appear in SC.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Can SC team + SLS look into a trigger button for school users to trigger a sync so that all the teaching groups involved can be updated. It takes very long for the sync to happen and manual pulling of new student names is very slow.</strong></p>
<p>The R19 ability to add students to existing SLS Class Groups will allow you to add new students to a class immediately while waiting for the sync with School Cockpit.  After the sync occurs, the student will automatically be treated like other students in the Class Group.</p>

	<ol>
<li><strong>Are locked accounts in SLS the same as expired password?</strong> 
No, locked accounts are due to the wrong password being used too many times and need to be unlocked by an SLS school admin.
Expired passwords are those which have been unchanged for more than a year and can be automatically reset by the user.</li>
<li><strong>When students SLS account are locked, can they use MIMS to log in?</strong>
Students cannot log in to MIMS if their account is locked.  Locking accounts after multiple unsuccessful login attempts is meant to deter brute force hacking attacks.</li>
<li><strong>A flexi-adjunct teacher (FAJT), relief teacher or ICT Manager/Associate is unable to log in to SLS. What steps can be taken to resolve it?</strong></li>
<li><p><strong>I am on secondment/No-Pay-Leave and am no longer able to log in to SLS. How may I regain access to SLS?</strong></p>
<p> For Q1 and Q2,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Ensure that the affected user has an active MIMS account.</li>
<li>Check that the affected user has applied and been granted with SLS access in MIMS portal (<a href="https://mims.moe.gov.sg/">https://mims.moe.gov.sg/</a>). 
Note:  SLS access can only be granted to ICT Manager/Associates if they are performing the SLS School Admin role. For assistance in applying for SLS access in MIMS, users may contact their MIMS Local Admin or SSOE 2 Service Desk (<a href="mailto:help@schools.gov.sg">help@schools.gov.sg</a>).</li>
<li>After the MIMS account has been activated and SLS access has been granted in MIMS, please allow 3 to 5 days for the SLS account to be activated.</li>
<li>If the affected user still encounters login difficulties, please contact the SLS Helpdesk (<a href="mailto:helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com">helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com</a>) for further assistance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What is the procedure for schools to apply for SLS access for students on Leave of Absence (LOA)? Do schools still need to write in to <a href="mailto:SLS_Ops@moe.gov.sg">SLS_Ops@moe.gov.sg</a>?</strong></p>
<p> Schools are recommended to assign a student into a form class before placing the student on LOA. After which, schools may follow the procedure below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Ensure that the LOA students' MIMS accounts are active, if not, the MIMS Student Admin (SA) should reactivate their accounts.</li>
<li>If the MIMS SA has difficulties reactivating/locating the LOA students' MIMS accounts, please contact the  SSOE 2 Service Desk (<a href="mailto:help@schools.gov.sg">help@schools.gov.sg</a>) for assistance.</li>
<li><p>Please continue to send in the LOA application form to  <a href="mailto:SLS_Ops@moe.gov.sg">SLS_Ops@moe.gov.sg</a> so that the students' SLS accounts can be assigned to your school.</p>
	<p><u>Note</u>: If the MIMS SA has contacted SSOE Service Desk and SSOE Service Desk has provided confirmation that the MIMS account of the student does not exist, please forward the email to SLS Ops for further assistance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I am able to log in to SLS but no longer able to access the SLS School Admin features. What can be done to reinstate my SLS School Admin role?</strong></p>
<p> Your school admin role might have been removed in the previous month’s verification exercise. If your school admin role had been removed accidentally, please request the verifier or a school leader to write in to <a href="mailto:SLS_Ops@moe.gov.sg">SLS_Ops@moe.gov.sg</a> for reinstatement of the role.</p>
<p> If your SLS account was recently inactivated (you were unable to log in) due to an inactive MIMS account, your school admin role would have been removed during account inactivation. You will need to reapply for the school admin role.</p>
<p> Please note that school admin roles are school-specific. If you have transferred to a new school, your new school would need to apply for the school admin role for you with approval from the school leader in your new school.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>For students new to SLS (e.g. Primary 1 students in the new year), do they log in using their MIMS account only?</strong></p>
<p> When logging into SLS for the first time, students will need to use the SLS OTP generated by their teachers and click on “Login with SLS” to set-up their accounts. For subsequent logins, students may use the MIMS login option. </p>
<p> Login via SLS will remain available to all students, including Primary 1 students. Primary school students are encouraged to use their SLS Login to access SLS (as per current practice) due to the complexity and length of the MIMS Login ID.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Will MIMS login (for students) be enforced as the only way to log in for SLS in the future?</strong></p>
<p> There is no definite timeline to cease the alternate SLS login. The SLS Office will inform schools in advance of any change.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A new school leader has recently joined our school. However, he/she is not included in the verification exercise email list. How can he/she be included?</strong></p>
<p> The email list for the verification exercise is generated on the 10th of each month automatically by the system. If the school leader has joined the school after the 10th of the month, he/she will be automatically included from the subsequent month’s verification.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I believe I have completed the verification exercise but still received an email stating that I did not. How can I prevent this from happening?</strong></p>
<p>In December every year, there are two verification exercises ongoing simultaneously:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Verification of teacher/student accounts which has to be completed by school admins</li>
<li>Verification of SLS school admin roles which has to be completed by school leaders</li>
</ol>
<p>Please ensure that both exercises have been completed.</p>
<p>In other months, only the verification of school admin role is conducted. Please ensure that the “Complete Verification” button has been clicked. Schools may also take a screenshot of the verification page showing the completion status as documentary proof.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I forgot to complete the verification exercise and only realised it after the deadline. The verify users page is no longer accessible. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>Please email <a href="mailto:SLS_Ops@moe.gov.sg">SLS_Ops@moe.gov.sg</a> before the last day of the month to inform SLS Office manually whether there are any accounts/roles which needs to be removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How do I log a ticket in SLS?</strong></p>
<p>Send us an email at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com">helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com</a>. Alternatively, you can click <strong>Help us improve</strong>, provide us a rating of your experience, and key in the issue in the form that follows. </p>
<p>For more information, visit <a target="_blank" href="/login-troubleshooting/get-help/contact-sls-helpdesk/">Helpdesk</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Can I report bugs through SgLDC?</strong></p>
<p>SgLDC is a community meant for teachers to share, learn and design technology-enabled learning experiences for future-ready learners. While some teachers do post their experiences with SLS, often than not, other teachers in the community are quick to provide solutions.</p>
<p>Should a user wishes to report a bug, do send an email to helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com or click the “Help us improve” widget.</p>

	<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2></summary>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Does the timetable in SLS reflects synchronously if we update the google / outlook calendar?</strong></p>
<p>No. It will not be synchronised. It will be correct at the point of import.  However, we encourage teachers to use the SLS Planner directly to plan T&amp;L related activities after the initial upload, as the Planner can be used to set new events just like a Google/Outlook calendar.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>For SLS Planner, can this be shared with other colleagues?</strong></p>
<p>You can create events in the Class Group. Other teachers in the Class Group will then be able to see the events on their calendar.</p>
</li>
