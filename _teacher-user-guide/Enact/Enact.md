<li><p><strong>Why do I have to enter an ITT or Discussion card to view Comments?</strong></p>
<p> ITT and Discussion cards have been enlarged to allow teachers and students to view more of the body message (especially when there is a Media Object attached). As such, Comments are placed within cards, reducing the amount of text shown on the screen which helps ensure a pleasant user experience.</p>
