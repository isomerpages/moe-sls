<h3>Password Reset Email</h3>
<p>When you use the <strong>Forgot Password</strong> feature to reset your
password, an email with a password reset link will be sent to you. If you
cannot find the email in your inbox, it may be in the spam/junk folder.</p>
<p>If you are unable to see the password reset email in your inbox, please
check:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>if your MIMS account is still active by logging in at <a href="https://mims.moe.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://mims.moe.gov.sg/</a>.
If it has become inactive, please approach your school/branch's MIMS Local
Administrator to reactivate the account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have applied for SLS access through the MIMS portal [only applicable
to Flexi-adjunct teacher, relief teacher, independent school direct hire
and Executive and Administrative Staff (EAS) holding the school admin role].
If you have not, please apply through <a href="https://mims.moe.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://mims.moe.gov.sg/</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After the MIMS account is reactivated or the SLS access is granted via
MIMS, the status of your SLS account will be restored within three - five
days, after which you can try resetting your password again.</p>
<p>If the problem persists, please contact the SLS Helpdesk at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com</a> or
call 6702 6513.</p>
