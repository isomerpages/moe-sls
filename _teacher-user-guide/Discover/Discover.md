<h4>G. Tech Tips for Teachers</h4>
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>I tried to embed a website using the embed code/URL but SLS does not allow me to.</strong></p>
<p> If a website has not been whitelisted, you will not be able to embed the site in SLS. An alternative would be to insert a link in the Rich Text Editor by clicking <strong>Insert/edit link</strong> (<strong>Chain</strong> icon). You have the option to decide whether the link will be opened in a new window or the current window. When students click on the link, they will be redirected accordingly.</p>
<p> For more information, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/discover/embed-whitelisted-websites/">Whitelisted Websites for Embedding</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The YouTube videos in my Module are not accessible.</strong></p>
<p> This could be due to a variety of reasons. First check that the video has not been taken down by YouTube by trying to access the video link outside SLS. Secondly, if the device is a student Personal Learning Device (PLD) with a Device Management Application (DMA), it could be blocked by the DMA. You will know this is the case if the student can access the Youtube video on his/her phone. In this case, ask your DMA vendor to whitelist the video. Thirdly, if the YouTube video is only inaccessible on the school network, then it is likely that the video is not whitelisted on SSN. You may wish to approach your network administrator for help.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Are there likely to be future collaborations with other Apps (e.g Nearpod, Microsoft)?</strong></p>
<p> For now, only Google has been integrated with SLS. However, the team is exploring other possible integrations. Should you wish to request for an app, kindly write to helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Is Kami whitelisted and approved to install/add on in all school laptops?</strong></p>
<p> Yes, Kami has been whitelisted for SSOE devices. Should you face any issues installing it on your SSOE device, please approach your school IT administrator or HOD ICT.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Whom should schools reach out to if they wish to learn more about the Adaptive Learning System (ALS)?</strong>
<p></p><p>Schools are highly encouraged to first check in with their respective Cluster ETOs. As ALS is already rolled out to all schools for Primary 5 students for three topics - Decimals, Whole Numbers and Percentages, schools may refer to the following resources below.</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/als-eped">ALS e-Pedagogy Guide</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="/files/Userguide/Downloadable%20Resources/als_14_feb.pdf">ALS e-poster</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOLmizePspE">Detailed video walkthrough</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="/student-user-guide/self-study/access-adaptive-learning-system/">Information on SLS Info guide</a></li>
</ol><p></p></li>
<li><strong>Can teachers review modules that are shared with them from my drive?</strong>
<p>Only modules shared on MOE Library and Community Gallery Modules can receive reviews. Teachers can view and add review for Modules on both MOE Library and CG. This allows Modules in MOE Library and Community Gallery to receive timely feedback and for other teachers to learn how to use the resource more effectively.</p>
<p>For more information, you may visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/discover/leave-reviews/">Leave Reviews</a>.  </p></li>
<li><strong>Can the review feature be used to provide me feedback on modules submitted to Community Gallery for admin approval?</strong>
<p>MOE Library Content Approvers and Community Gallery Admins can use admin reviews to give feedback for the submitted modules. The submitters of the modules are also able to reply to the feedback via the same subpage. Admin feedback will be hidden when the module is published in MOE Library and Community Gallery.</p></li>
<li><strong>Can SLS make it easier to verify the quality of modules in the Community Gallery?</strong>
<p>Since R19 (Jun 2023), teachers are already able to <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/discover/leave-reviews/">Leave Reviews</a> for modules on MOE Library and Community Gallery. You may use these reviews as indicators of a Module’s quality and/or leave reviews for others to do the same. </p></li>
<li><strong>Can teachers monitor students’ self-study list?</strong>
<p>Teachers do not have access to view students' individual self-study lists. Instead, they can only view students' overall self-study performance through Learning Progress. On the student tab, teachers can find the Module titles students have attempted and the marks they received for these attempts. Do note in order to make this data visible in Learning Progress, it's essential that the subject, level and content map tags on Modules and questions match those of the Class Group.</p>
<p>Do note that for MOE Library Modules, the tags are not controlled by teachers but by the respective curriculum divisions.</p></li>
<li><strong>Do teachers have to assign students their self-study materials?</strong>
<p>Students can browse for learning resources independently from the MOE Library/App Library and My Drive. Upon attempt/completing the learning resource, it will be automatically added into the student’s self-study list.</p>
<p>When assignments are set to enable copying to My Drive, students can also reattempt assignments as part of their self-study. These resources will also be added to student's self-study list.</p>
<p>Primary 5 students can also access the Adaptive Learning System (ALS), which provides a personalised learning pathway for each student, recommending learning resources and practice questions and offering immediate feedback based on his/her readiness.</p>
<p>Alternatively, students can access learning resources uploaded by subject teachers in the respective Class Groups under Class Group Resources. However, teachers will not be able to monitor student's completion rate for such resources.</p></li>
<li><strong>Can the current year's teacher monitor students' progress when they move on to the next academic year?</strong>
<p>Teachers will only be able to access students' past Assignments, Resources, Forum and Apps if they had a Class Group in the same subject and level as the student in the past year.</p>
<p>However, past year's subject teachers can be added to the new year's class group and move past year's assignments into the new year's class group. This will allow the new year's subject teachers to monitor students' progress for such assignments.</p></li>
<li><strong>Can teacher provide feedback to the self-study courses?</strong>
<p>The teacher is unable to provide feedback to the self-study courses. You may refer to the following links for more information:</p>
