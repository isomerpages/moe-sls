<h4>G. Tech Tips for Teachers</h4>
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>I tried to embed a website using the embed code/URL but SLS does not allow me to.</strong></p>
<p> If a website has not been whitelisted, you will not be able to embed the site in SLS. An alternative would be to insert a link in the Rich Text Editor by clicking <strong>Insert/edit link</strong> (<strong>Chain</strong> icon). You have the option to decide whether the link will be opened in a new window or the current window. When students click on the link, they will be redirected accordingly.</p>
<p> For more information, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/discover/embed-whitelisted-websites/">Whitelisted Websites for Embedding</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The YouTube videos in my Lessons are not accessible.</strong></p>
<p> This could be due to a variety of reasons. First check that the video has not been taken down by YouTube by trying to access the video link outside SLS. Secondly, if the device is a student Personal Learning Device (PLD) with a Device Management Application (DMA), it could be blocked by the DMA. You will know this is the case if the student can access the Youtube video on his/her phone. In this case, ask your DMA vendor to whitelist the video. Thirdly, if the YouTube video is only inaccessible on the school network, then it is likely that the video is not whitelisted on SSN. You may wish to approach your network administrator for help.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Are there likely to be future collaborations with other Apps (e.g Nearpod, Microsoft)?</strong></p>
<p> For now, only Google has been integrated with SLS. However, the team is exploring other possible integrations. Should you wish to request for an app, kindly write to helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Is Kami whitelisted and approved to install/add on in all school laptops?</strong></p>
<p> Yes, Kami has been whitelisted for SSOE devices. Should you face any issues installing it on your SSOE device, please approach your school IT administrator or HOD ICT.</p>
