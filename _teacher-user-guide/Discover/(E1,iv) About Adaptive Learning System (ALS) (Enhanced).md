<h1>(E1,iv) About Adaptive Learning System (ALS) (Enhanced)</h1>
<ol>The Adaptive Learning System (ALS) provides a customised learning pathway for each student, recommending learning resources and practice questions and offering immediate feedback based on his/her readiness. Students can access the ALS through the Student Learning Space (SLS) for self-directed learning. With the ALS, students learn independently, at their own pace, according to their strengths and needs.</ol>
<ol>Teachers are able to use Student View to experience ALS as a student, if you are given access. Open the right menu and click <strong>Switch to Student Account</strong> and follow the steps in <a target="_blank" href="/student-user-guide/self-study/access-adaptive-learning-system/">Access Adaptive Learning System (ALS)</a>.</ol>
