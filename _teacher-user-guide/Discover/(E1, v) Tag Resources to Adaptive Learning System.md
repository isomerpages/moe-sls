<h1>(E1, v) Tag Resources to Adaptive Learning System</h1>
<p>ALS has been enhanced to allow teachers to better customise ALS according to the needs of their students. Teachers can tag their own content and assessment items to ALS content maps and allow these to be recommended by ALS for their students, in addition to existing content items developed by CPDD.</p>
<h2>Overview of how to add resources to ALS</h2>

<u>Note</u>:
<p>Before tagging content to ALS, departments are encouraged to create level/ school-wide Student Groups to alleviate the need for teachers to upload resources individually for each class. To learn how to create level/ school-wide Student Groups, click <a target="_blank" href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/teacher-user-guide/organise/create-class-groups/">here</a>.</p>

<tbody><tr><th> Activities in Section</th><th>Active Learning Process </th><th>Suggested Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>Activity 1</td><td>ALP 1: Activate Learning</td><td>Videos, interactive tools, open-ended questions to activate students’ prior knowledge</td></tr>
<tr><td>Activity 2</td><td>ALP 2: Promote Thinking and Discussion </td><td>Text/ Media objects to present new knowledge and guide students in deepening their learning </td></tr>
<tr><td>Activity 3</td><td>ALP 3: Facilitate Demonstration of Learning </td><td>Multiple choice questions, free response questions to allow students to consolidate and apply their knowledge, and receive feedback.</td></tr>
