<h1>Access App Library</h1>
    <p>SLS allows system capabilities to be extended via integration with external
      applications. This accelerates the adoption and integration of new digital
      learning tools and resources complementary to SLS. The App Library contains
      a list of whitelisted Apps that can be launched within SLS.
