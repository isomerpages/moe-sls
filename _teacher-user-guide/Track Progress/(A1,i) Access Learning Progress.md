<p>Learning Progress shows the overall progress (in terms of marks) of students in a Class Group based on their attempted assignments and self-study resources. Teachers can select questions they wish to monitor and view them from the Learning Progress page.</p>
<p>The overall progress includes the marks for all assignments containing questions (tagged or untagged to the current Content Mapsyllabus) that have been assigned to a particular Class Group.</p>
<p>Note: Learning Progress page can be accessed for Class Groups synced from School Cockpit. For Class Groups created in SLS, you will need to add a Subject and Level to view the Learning Progress.</p>
