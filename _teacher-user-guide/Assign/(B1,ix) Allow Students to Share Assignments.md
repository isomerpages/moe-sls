<h2 id="-student-interaction-in-shared-assignment-">Student Interaction in Shared Assignment</h2>
<hr>
<p>Assignment sharing is mutual between two students. For example, student A requests to share with student B, and student B accepts. Both students A and B can see each other's assignment. Student A can further share his/her assignment with student C by repeating the process to request and accept.</p>
<ul>
<li>The possible interactions when an assignment is shared are as follows:
<ul>
<li>View each other's assignment, including Activities with restricted access where the other student might not otherwise be able to view.</li>
<li>View and comment on each other's Notes and Annotations (highlight).</li>
<img alt="Allow Students to Share Assignments" style="width: 100%;" src="/images/2Teacher/AS-AllowShare3.png">
<li>Viewing student's highlights and notes.
</li>	
<li>View teacher's Annotation made to a student's copy of the Assignment.
</li>
<li><p>View each other's answers and scores to questions, and any Teacher Feedback.</p></li></ul>
<p><u>Note</u>:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Teachers are able to delete comments.</p>

<li>Students will not be able to complete the Assignment on behalf of the student who shared the Assignment.</li>
