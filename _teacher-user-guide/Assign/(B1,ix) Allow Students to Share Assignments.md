<h1>(B1,ix) Allow Students to Share Assignments</h1>
<hr>
<p><u>Note</u>: From Dec 2025 Update, students can maintain a study buddy
list which automatically shares shareable assignments, so that they can
see each other’s work for revision, peer review, sharing of assignment
notes and answers.</p>
<h2>Student-Sharing Permissions</h2>
<p>Teachers can toggle Sharing Permissions to allow students to share their
Assignments automatically with their study buddies. Students will be able
to see other students' responses, Notes, and Teacher Feedback once shared.
Once allowed, permission to share cannot be revoked.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sharing Permissions can be turned on while:</p>

<h2>Student Interaction in Shared Assignment</h2>
<hr>
<p>Assignment sharing is mutual between two students. For example, student
A requests to share with student B, and student B accepts. Both students
A and B can see each other's assignment. Student A can further share his/her
assignment with student C by repeating the process to request and accept.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The possible interactions when an assignment is shared are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>View each other's assignment, including Activities with restricted access
where the other student might not otherwise be able to view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View and comment on each other's Notes and Annotations (highlight).</p>
