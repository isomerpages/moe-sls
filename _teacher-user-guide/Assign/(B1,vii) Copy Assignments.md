<h1 id="copy-assignments">(B1,vii) Copy Assignments</h1>
<p>You can copy an Assignment after it has been assigned and/or attempted by students. This is helpful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teachers who have edited their original Lesson and wish to save a copy in My Drive</li>
<li>Co-teachers of a Class Group to have a copy of an Assignment even if the Lesson is not shared.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Click the Assignment card to enter the Assignment. </li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Overflow</strong> (3-dots icon) to open the right menu and select <strong>Copy to My Drive</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="Copy Assignments" style="width: 50%;" src="/images/2Teacher/AS-CopyAssignment1.png"></p>
	<p><u>Note</u>: If Copy to My Drive is greyed out, it means <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assign/allow-students-to-copy-assignments/">permission</a> has not been granted by the author of the Assignment. This restriction applies even to the author of the Assignment. To lift this restriction, the Class Group owner or Co-teacher will need to edit the <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assign/edit-assignments/">Assignment Settings</a> and check the box besides <b>Allow teachers to copy/assign/publish and students to copy this lesson</b>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the folder you would like to store the Lesson in, then click <strong>Copy</strong>. This Lesson will now be stored in My Drive under My Lessons tab.</p>
</li>
</ol>
