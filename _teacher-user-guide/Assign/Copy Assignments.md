<ol>
<li>Click the Assignment card to enter the Assignment. </li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Overflow</strong> (3-dots icon) to open the right menu and select <strong>Copy to My Drive</strong>.</p>

	<p><u>Note</u>: If Copy to My Drive is greyed out, it means <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assign/allow-students-to-copy-assignments/">permission</a> has not been granted by the author of the Lesson.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the folder you would like to store the Lesson in, then click <strong>Copy</strong>. This Lesson will now be stored in My Drive under My Lessons tab.</p>
