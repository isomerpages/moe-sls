<p><strong>Important</strong>: Student answers that have not been saved as draft before an assignment is paused, will not reappear after the assignment has been resumed.</p>
<p>You may pause and resume an Assignment temporarily if you do not want students to have access to the Assignment.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click the Assignment card to enter the Assignment and click the <strong>Pause Assignment</strong> icon <img style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;" src="/images/Icons/Pause.svg">. A blue banner will indicate whether an Assignment is paused.</p>
	<p><u>Note</u>: Students will not be able to attempt a paused Assignment, and will view that the assignment is paused on the Assignment card or the Assignment Cover. If they are in the process of attempting an assignment when the assignment is paused, they will receive a prompt.</p>
