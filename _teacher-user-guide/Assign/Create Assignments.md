<h1 id="create-assignments">Create Assignments</h1>
<p>You can create an Assignment by assigning a Lesson to students in your Class Groups.</p>
<p>You can turn your <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assess/set-assignments-as-assessments/">Assignment into an Assessment</a>. An Assessment Card is differentiated with a beige background.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: For a better user experience, Assignments with over 100 assignees will need to be split into multiple assignments with a maximum of 100 students. </p>
