<h1 id="create-assignments">Create Assignments</h1>
<p>You can create an Assignment by assigning a Lesson to students in your Class Groups.</p>
<p>You can turn your <a href="https://docs.learning.moe.edu.sg/sls/teachers/user-guide/vle/teacher/AssignmentFeedback/SetAsAssessment.html">Assignment into an Assessment</a>. An Assessment Card is differentiated with a beige background.</p>
<p>Note: For a better user experience, Assignments with over 100 assignees will need to be split into multiple assignments with a maximum of 100 students. </p>
