<summary><h4>F. Tech Tips for Teachers</h4></summary>
<ol>
<li><strong>I can’t download student marks and responses in Heatmap. When I click on the incoming notification that the download is ready (this can take up to 10 to 15 minutes), nothing happens.</strong>
<p><strong>When I click to download a zipped resource, nothing happens.</strong></p>
<p> For the questions above, you will need to ensure that your browser settings for the SLS site is set to “enable pop-ups” by going to Settings -&gt; Privacy and Security -&gt; Site Settings. This is a known issue for Chrome and Safari browsers.</p>
<p> For more information, download the <a target="_blank" href="/files/Userguide/Downloadable%20Resources/Enable-Pop-ups-Guide.pdf">"Enable Pop-up" Guide</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I am not able to extract zipped files (e.g. student responses) that I have downloaded from SLS because of the length of the file names.</strong></p>
<p> Try shortening the name of the zip file and also extracting it into the root drive (e.g. “D:/”).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Can a teacher provide feedback/mass feedback to questions in quizzes that are not Teacher-Marked Quizzes?</strong></p>
<p> Yes, teachers are able to provide feedback to multiple students for a Free-Response, Audio-Response, and File-Submission question within an Activity, or a Quiz.</p>
<p> For more information, visit Add Teacher’s Feedback.</p>
<p> When you set any quiz as a Team Quiz, all members of the same Activity Team will also receive the same feedback.</p>
<p> For more information, visit Create Teams.</p>
<p> However, teachers can award marks to multiple students for such question types in a Teacher-Marked Quiz only.</p>
<p> For more information, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assess/mark-teacher-marked-quizzes/">Mark a Teacher-Marked Quiz</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What are the affordances for teachers with Google Integration in SLS?</strong></p>
<p> With Google Integration, teachers can seamlessly embed existing teaching resources into SLS, which will be pre-populated for individual students. Marking and providing feedback can be easily done through SLS as well. To view the overall class progress and submission, teachers may do so from the Monitor Assignment page. Marking of Google Files will have to be done individually. </p>
<p> For more information on Google Integration, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/collaborate/attach-google-files/">About Google Integration</a>.</p>
<p> For more information on marking on Google Files, visit <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assess/mark-google-attached-files/">Mark Google-Attached Files</a>.</p>
<p> For more information on monitoring your students’ Assignment, visit Monitor Students’ Responses in an Assignment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Can students retrieve their work on Google Apps easily if done in SLS?</strong></p>
<p> Yes, they can open their work directly from the Assignment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Does SLS have an exam/test mode?</strong></p>
<p>SLS has a range of features that support assessment. One of them is the 
<a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assess/set-assignments-as-assessments/">“Assessment” feature</a>
that can be used on SSOE2 ACAD device with ITD lock down mode.</p>
