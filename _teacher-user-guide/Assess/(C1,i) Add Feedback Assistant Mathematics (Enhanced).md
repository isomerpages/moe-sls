<h1>(C1,i) Add Feedback Assistant Mathematics</h1>

<p>The Feedback Assistant - Mathematics (FA-Math) is an engine that offers step-by-step feedback to students on their answers.</p>
<p><u>Important</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>FA-Math can be added as Prepopulated Student Answer in a Free-Response Question. Students will be informed that FA-Math will provide feedback for the question.</li>
<li>File Submission and Suggested Answer Field are disabled when using FA-Math.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><p>Select <strong>Free-Response</strong> then <strong>Feedback Assistant - Mathematics</strong> under Questions in the Component Bar. The Create New Question subpage will open.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Alternatively, you can choose Default Free-Response then click the checkbox next to <strong>Use</strong> and select <strong>Feedback Assistant - Mathematics</strong>. In the Prepopulated Student Answer, click the <strong>Create a Mathematics question</strong> icon <img src="/images/Icons/algebrakit.svg" style="width:1.5rem; display: inline;"> to open the Create New Question subpage.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li><p>In the Create New Question subpage, check the box whether you would like to show hints and feedback while students attempt the question.</p></li>
<img alt="(C1,i) Add Feedback Assistant - Mathematics (FA-Math)" src="/images/2Teacher/AS_FA_Math_Qn2.png" style="width: 100%;">
	<li><p>Click <strong>Audience</strong> to select from a dropdown menu the level of your students. FA-Math would customise the hints and feedback based on the students’ level.</p></li><img alt="(C1,i) Add Feedback Assistant - Mathematics (FA-Math)" src="/images/2Teacher/AS_FA_Math_Qn3.png" style="width: 100%;">
		<li><p>Select the question type that you would like to create using FA-Math. From June 2024 (R1), teachers can select the Bar Model method to allow students to present their solutions as models instead of algebraic equations.</p></li>
	<img alt="(C1,i) Add Feedback Assistant - Mathematics (FA-Math)" src="/images/2Teacher/AS_FA_Math_Qn4.png" style="width: 100%;">
	<li>When you are done, click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
	<li><p>From June 2024 (R1), students would be able to provide handwriting input(s) using the formula editor. This would increase the ease of use of FA-Math, especially for students who might not be so used to entering Math formulas and equations digitally. Click <a target="_blank" href="/student-user-guide/assess/about-mathematics-feedback-assistant/">here</a> to find out how students can utilise this function for FA-Math questions.</p>
	<img alt="(C1,i) Add Feedback Assistant - Mathematics (FA-Math)" src="/images/2Teacher/AS_FA_Math3a.png" style="width: 100%;">Note that the handwriting function is also enabled for students’ use in other parts of SLS.</li>
