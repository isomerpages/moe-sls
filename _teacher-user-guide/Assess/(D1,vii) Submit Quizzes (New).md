<hr>
<p>
When a student does not submit a Quiz, you can submit the Quiz on behalf of the student. This is useful in cases where students do work in an embedded app or website and you are using SLS to monitor and provide comments. This can also be coupled with the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/author/add-rubrics-to-audio-and-free-response-questions/">Rubrics</a> feature</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the&nbsp;<strong>Monitor Assignment</strong>&nbsp;page, click on the name of the student to open the quiz.</li>
<li>Proceed to the Quiz Completion page.</li>
<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Submit for Student.</strong></li>
