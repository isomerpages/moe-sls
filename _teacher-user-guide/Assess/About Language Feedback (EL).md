<h2>Add Language Feedback (EL)</h2>

<strong>Important</strong>: Language Feedback (EL) is currently undergoing a pilot in participating schools and will be available for wider access upon the conclusion of the pilot.

<ol>

    - Alternatively, you can choose Default Free-Response then click the checkbox next to <strong>Use</strong> and select <strong>Language Feedback (EL)</strong>.<br>
