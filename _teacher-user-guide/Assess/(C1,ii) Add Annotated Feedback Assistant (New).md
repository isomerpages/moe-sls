<h1>(C1,ii) Add Annotated Feedback Assistant (New)</h1>
<hr>

The Annotated Feedback Assistant (AFA) provides targeted in-line feedback on both content and language through annotation cards, using Suggested Answer, Rubrics, and Error Tags to help students refine their responses. With AFA, teachers can also use specific instructions to configure the feedback given (e.g. provide the correct response, hint, or probing questions) to meet their students’ learning needs.

Important:

*   As AFA uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic in nature. Thus, it may not always identify errors comprehensively, and teachers should review and refine the feedback to ensure accuracy and alignment with learning objectives.
*   File Submission is disabled when using AFA.

<ol>
<li><p>AFA can be used in standalone questions and all types of quizzes. If you wish to review feedback from AFA before releasing it to students, you can include the AFA enabled question within a Teacher Marked Quiz.  </p>
