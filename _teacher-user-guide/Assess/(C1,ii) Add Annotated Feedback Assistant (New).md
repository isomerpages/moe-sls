<h1>(C1,ii) Add Annotated Feedback Assistant (New)</h1>
<hr>
<p>The Annotated Feedback Assistant (AFA) provides targeted in-line feedback
on both content and language through annotation cards, using Suggested
Answer, Rubrics, and Error Tags to help students refine their responses.
With AFA, you can also use specific instructions to configure the feedback
given (e.g. provide the correct response, hint, or probing questions) to
meet their students’ learning needs. You can now allow students to check
their responses to Free Response Questions (FRQs) using AFA before submitting,
enabling them to act on feedback immediately by revising and improving
their answers.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As AFA uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic in nature. Thus,
it may not always identify errors comprehensively, and you should review
and refine the feedback to ensure accuracy and alignment with learning
objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File Submission is disabled when using AFA. Note: Students who submit
Google Files as responses should use the Short Answer Feedback Assistant
instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before using AI-enabled features in SLS, you are encouraged to have students
complete the Basic Modules for AI and AI-enabled features in SLS in the
following links:</p>

<p>AFA can be used in standalone questions and all types of quizzes. If you
wish to review feedback from AFA before releasing it to students, you can
include the AFA enabled question within a Teacher Marked Quiz.</p>

<p><strong>[New]</strong> In the setup subpage, you can now specify the <strong>number of drafts</strong> a
student is allowed to check for feedback using AFA. This means students
can revise and check their answer multiple times, receiving updated feedback
each time — up to the limit set by you.</p>
<p><em>Tip: The default value is set to 0. Should you choose to set to 1, students will only be able to check once. Increase this value (up to 9) if you'd like to encourage more iterative drafting and feedback.</em>

<p>Some helpful tips on writing the suggested answer:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When using images or PDFs for suggested answers, ensure clarity and readability
by using high-quality scans or images with legible text or handwriting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearly indicate key points through annotations, highlights, or labels,
and align the marking scheme by providing a text-based breakdown of criteria
where necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If multiple answers are acceptable, specify alternatives either within
the image or as a separate explanation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PDFs can be useful for structured responses, such as worked solutions,
annotated diagrams, or essay-style answers, with clear indications of how
each section aligns with the marks awarded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where possible, providing an exemplar response can help guide students
in understanding expected formatting and content depth.

<p>Alternatively, to mark more open-ended responses based on rubrics, you
may use <strong>Rubrics</strong> as a reference, by entering the following
fields:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Title</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Band Descriptor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Criterion</p>

<li>
<p>Mark Range</p>
</li>

<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SAFARubrics.png">
</div>
<p><u>Note:</u> A maximum of 6 bands (columns) and 6 criteria (rows) can be
added in a Rubrics. Click the Overflow (3-dot icon) to Add Band, Add Criterion,
Delete Band, or Delete Criterion.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also select a recipe to further customise the feedback generated
by AFA to better meet students’ needs, e.g. suggest direct replacements,
provide questions to trigger deeper thinking, or give hints to guide students.</p>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2Teacher/AS_AFA6.png">

<p>Additionally, you may choose to use Short Answer Feedback Assistant concurrently
to allow students to receive holistic feedback as well.</p>

<li>
<p>After editing, click outside the Component to save.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before assigning to students, you can preview the feedback by clicking <strong>Preview as Student</strong> to
ensure that the question has been configured correctly.</p>

<p><u>Note:</u> Students will receive feedback automatically for Standalone
Questions, Auto-Graded and Progressive Quizzes. For Teacher Marked Quizzes,
you have to mark and return the feedback before your students can receive
it. Click <a href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/teacher-user-guide/assess/release-teacher-marked-quizzes/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here </a>to
