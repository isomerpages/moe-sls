<h1>(C1,ii) Add Annotated Feedback Assistant (New)</h1>
<hr>
<p>The Annotated Feedback Assistant (AFA) provides targeted in-line feedback
on both content and language through annotation cards, using Suggested
Answer, Rubrics, and Error Tags to help students refine their responses.
With AFA, teachers can also use specific instructions to configure the
feedback given (e.g. provide the correct response, hint, or probing questions)
to meet their students’ learning needs.</p>
<p>Important:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As AFA uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic in nature. Thus,
it may not always identify errors comprehensively, and teachers should
review and refine the feedback to ensure accuracy and alignment with learning
objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File Submission is disabled when using AFA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Create an AFA question</strong></h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>
<p>AFA can be used in standalone questions and all types of quizzes. If you
wish to review feedback from AFA before releasing it to students, you can
include the AFA enabled question within a Teacher Marked Quiz.</p>
