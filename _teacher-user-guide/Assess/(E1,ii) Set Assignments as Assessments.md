<p><u> Did You Know</u>:</p>
<p>If you do not wish to create an Assessment (which will require the whitelisting
of embedded links or apps), you may wish to <a href="/teacher-user-guide/assess/add-and-view-access-codes/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">set a Access Code (formerly known as Passcode) to an Assignment</a>.
Students will require the Access Code before they can attempt the Assignment.</p>
<p>From R3 (after 4 Dec 25), teachers can edit all question types, included
as part of a Multiple-Part Question (MPQ), even after students have attempted
them. Teachers and students can also view the last edited date and time
of the question.</p>
<p>Note: This is not applicable for students <strong>in assessments</strong>.</p>
