<h1>(C1,iii) Add Short Answer Feedback Assistant (Enhanced)</h1>
<p>The Short Answer Feedback Assistant (ShortAnsFA) provides suggested marks
and auto-generated content-related feedback for free-response questions for any subject and level.</p>
<p><u>Important</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As ShortAnsFA uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic in nature.
Thus, it may not be suitable for questions involving mathematical computation
and may at times be inaccurate. Teachers should review the feedback generated
before returning it to students. ShortAnsFA's capabilities will be continually
improved over time and schools can keep a lookout for the latest improvements
via the Singapore Learning Designers Circle (SgLDC) Facebook group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From June 2024 (R1), ShortAnsFA can provide feedback on a wider variety of responses, including more open-ended responses such as composition writing or reflections. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File Submission is disabled when using ShortAnsFA.</p>

</ul>
