<h1>(C1,iii) Add Short Answer Feedback Assistant (ShortAnsFA)</h1>
<p>The Short Answer Feedback Assistant (ShortAnsFA) provides suggested marks and auto-generated content-related feedback for close-ended, short answer questions for any subject and level.</p>
<p><u>Important</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teachers should pay special attention when using ShortAnsFA as feedback generated may not always be suitable or accurate.</li>
<li>ShortAnsFA should not be used for questions involving mathematical computation as it is unable to provide accurate feedback for mathematical concepts.</li>
<li>ShortAnsFA can only be added in a Free-Response Question as part of a Teacher-Marked Quiz.</li>
<li>File Submission is disabled when using ShortAnsFA.</li>
</ul>
