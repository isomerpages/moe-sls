<h1>(A2,2) Analyse Students’ Responses with Data Assistant (New)</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Analyse Students’ Reponses using Data Assistant</h2>
<hr>
<p>Data Assistant (DAT) is an AI-powered tool that helps teachers analyse qualitative data from student responses. It identifies and summarises major themes from discussions, highlights common misconceptions from students’ responses, and &nbsp;much more. This provides teachers with quick insights into students’ responses , and allows for more timely interventions.</p>
<p><u>Important</u>: As Data Assistant uses generative AI, its response is probabilistic in nature. Thus, it may be inaccurate at times. It is crucial that teachers carefully review the analysis provided and validate its accuracy before making any interventions based on it. </p>
<p>You can access Data Assistant from:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Aggregated Student Responses in Free-Response Questions</li>
