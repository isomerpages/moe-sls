<ol><li>From the <a target="_blank" href="/admin-user-guide/administer/about-manage-users/">Manage User</a> page, click <strong>Export Full User List</strong> to download a list of all SLS users in the school as a .csv file. The account information of new P1 students can be obtained by filtering the "Form Class" column in the downloaded list.</li>
<p><u>Note</u>: Please ensure you have enabled pop-ups before downloading the list. You may refer to the <a target="_blank" href="/files/Userguide/Downloadable%20Resources/Enable-Pop-ups-Guide.pdf">Enable Pop-Ups guide</a> on how you can enable pop-ups for your device.</p>
<li>Mail-merge these SLS IDs using a letter template provided by MOE HQ which will inform students and their parents of the SLS account details. The use of the letter template is important as it highlights the key messages of SLS and encourages parents to assist their children in managing their accounts in their first few years in Primary School.</li>
<li><p>To help students who have forgetten their SLS User IDs, SLS School Admins can search for their SLS User IDs through the Manage Users page.</p>
