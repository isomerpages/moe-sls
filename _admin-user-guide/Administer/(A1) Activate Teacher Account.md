<li>Teacher Accounts for permanent teachers employed by MOE in government and government-aided schools are automatically created using information from MIMS. There is no action required from schools since these accounts are auto-generated.</li>

<ol>
<li>Flexi-adjunct teachers</li>
<li>Relief teachers</li>
<li>Direct-hire teachers in independent or specialised schools</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The SLS account will be ready three days after SLS access is granted via MIMS.</p>
<p> <u>Note</u>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Please ensure that a MIMS account has been created for the teacher and is currently active.</li>
<li>Applications submitted through email will no longer be accepted.</li>
