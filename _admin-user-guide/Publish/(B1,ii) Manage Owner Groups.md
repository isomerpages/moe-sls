<h2 id="about-owner-group">About Owner Group</h2>
<hr>
<p>An Owner Group comprises of two groups of users - Content Approvers (CAs) and Content Officers (COs). Each Owner Group is tagged to a Subject, which is required before CAs can publish a Content Map.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: When searching for resources, Subjects without a Content Map will not be viewable from the Subject dropdown menu.</p>
<h2 id="about-content-approver-and-content-officer">About Content Approver and Content Officer</h2>
<hr>
<p>Content Approvers are able to publish <a target="_blank" href="/admin-user-guide/publish/manage-content-maps/">Content Maps</a>, <a target="_blank" href="/admin-user-guide/publish/manage-lessons/">Manage MOE Library Lessons</a>, and View Media. Content Approvers are also able to create Lessons that are meant to be published to MOE Library.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: MOE Library Media Objects are centrally managed by RMS. Any edits to Media Objects have to be done through RMS.</p>
<p>Content Officers can view Content Map, Media and MOE Library Lessons. Content Officers are also able to create Lessons that are meant to be published to <a target="_blank" href="/admin-user-guide/publish/create-moe-library-resources/">MOE Library</a>. These Lessons will be submitted to CAs for approval.</p>
<h2 id="creation-of-owner-group-and-subject-nomination-of-content-approver-and-content-officer-roles">Creation of Owner Group and Subject, Nomination of Content Approver and Content Officer Roles</h2>
<hr>
<p>The request for the creation of Owner Group and Subject and nomination of CA and CO roles will require the endorsement from the requestorâ€™s Branch Head. Once the Owner Group and Subject has been created, the nominated officers will be appointed with the requested CA/CO roles.</p>
