Unlock Account
==============

   How a Student Account Gets Locked
---------------------------------

---

 For security reasons, your account will be locked if:

- you try to log in with an incorrect password too many times, or
- you answer the security questions incorrectly too many times when resetting the password.
 
1. When you are unsuccessful at logging in, there will be a message to inform you. You may continue to attempt to log in until the Login button no longer works and you are informed you are unable to continue.  ![](images/Media/2Teacher/TSPStudentLoginAfter.png)  
2. If you do not reset your password after the Login button is greyed out and attempt to log in repeatedly after refreshing your browser or using a different browser or device, you run the risk of getting your account locked.
3. You will no longer be able to log in even if you enter the correct password and neither you nor your teacher will be able to reset your password.
