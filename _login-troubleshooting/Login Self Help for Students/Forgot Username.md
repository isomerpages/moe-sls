Forgot Username
===============

 Your username is usually the first 5 characters of your full name and last 4 digits of birth certificate number or NRIC together with the alphabet, e.g. TANAH2345X.

Note: Usernames will not contain spaces or special characters such as apostrophes (') and hyphens (-).

 Alternatively, please approach your school for help. You can find out how to search for your School-Based Helpline [here](/login-troubleshooting/SchoolBasedHelpline/).
