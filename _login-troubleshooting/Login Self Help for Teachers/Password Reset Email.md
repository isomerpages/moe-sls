Password Reset Email
===================

When you use the Forgot Password feature to reset your password, an email with a password reset link will be sent to you. If you cannot find the email in your inbox, it may be in the spam/junk folder.

 If you are unable to see the password reset email in your inbox, please check:

- if your MIMS account is still active by logging in at <a href="https://mims.moe.gov.sg/" target="_blank">https://mims.moe.gov.sg/</a>. If it has become inactive, please approach your school/branch's MIMS Local Administrator to reactivate the account.
- if you have applied for SLS access through the MIMS portal (only applicable to FAJT, relief teacher, independent school direct hire and EAS holding the school admin role). If you have not, please apply through <a href="https://mims.moe.gov.sg/" target="_blank">https://mims.moe.gov.sg/</a>.

 After the MIMS account is reactivated or the SLS access is granted via MIMS, the status of your SLS account will be restored within three days, after which you can try resetting your password again.

 If the problem persists, please contact the SLS Helpdesk at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com">helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com</a> or call 6702 6513.

 Note: If the link has expired, go to the login page and select **Forgot Password** to request for another link.
