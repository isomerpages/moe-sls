<h1 id="password-reset-email">Password Reset Email</h1>
<p>When you use the <strong>Forgot Password</strong> feature to reset your password, an email with a password reset link will be sent to you. If you cannot find the email in your inbox, it may be in the spam/junk folder.</p>
<p>If you are unable to see the password reset email in your inbox, please check: </p>
<ul>
<li>if your MIMS account is still active by logging in at <a target="_blank" href="https://mims.moe.gov.sg/">https://mims.moe.gov.sg/</a>. If it has become inactive, please approach your school/branch's MIMS Local Administrator to reactivate the account.</li>
<li>if you have applied for SLS access through the MIMS portal [only applicable to Flexi-adjunct teacher, relief teacher, independent school direct hire and Executive and Administrative Staff (EAS) holding the school admin role]. If you have not, please apply through <a target="_blank" href="https://mims.moe.gov.sg/">https://mims.moe.gov.sg/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the MIMS account is reactivated or the SLS access is granted via MIMS, the status of your SLS account will be restored within three - five days, after which you can try resetting your password again.</p>
<p>If the problem persists, please contact the SLS Helpdesk at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com">helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com</a> or call 6702 6513.</p>
