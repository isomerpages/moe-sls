<hr>
<p>When you use the Forgot Password feature to reset your password, an email with a password reset link will be sent to you. If you cannot find the email in your inbox, it may be in the spam/junk folder.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: If the link has expired, go to the login page and select <strong>Forgot Password</strong> to request another link.</p>
<p>It is also possible that you have not entered and verified your email address. If that's the case, you may either use the security questions or approach a teacher to reset your password. Remember to key in an email address after that for future password reset.</p>
<p>If the problem persists, please contact the school's SLS Administrator.</p>

<hr>
<p>If you need to log in to the SLS during class and have forgotten your password, your teacher can generate a 2-Hour Temporary Password (2HTP). The 2HTP only allows you to access the Assignments and MOE Library. It does not allow you to reset your password or change other details in your Profile.</p>
<p>This is only a temporary solution. If you have forgotten your password, you should try to reset it by following the steps above.</p>
