<p>Friends of SLS is a new initiative to recognise educators who have significantly contributed to the SLS fraternity over the last few years. We thank these educators for their contributions which include sharing on SLS features, creating SLS support guides and assisting other teachers with SLS-related queries on SgLDC. </p>                            
<p> To support them in sharing what they find useful and exciting about SLS with the community, we have provisioned them with a 2-year special account in the SLS Sandbox. The SLS Sandbox is usually updated 1.5 months before each release, allowing them to get a sneak peek of the pre-release features. They can also look forward to early invitations to special sharing sessions, workshops, user research/feedback sessions and other “live” events over the next 2 years.</p>
