<h4>Real-Time Feedback Sparks Student Excitement</h4>
<p>“Just today, I attended a colleague’s lesson which utilised the SLS <strong>feedback assistant</strong> –
the immediate feedback provided students with a <strong>meaningful way to self-direct and process their learning</strong>,
and I could see them excitedly buzzing together over the comments they
received. Please know SLS is having<strong> real impact </strong>on the
ground!” – Secondary School Principal</p>

<h4>Instant Speech Evaluation that Matches Teacher Assessment</h4>
<p>“The <strong>Speech Evaluation Tool (SE)</strong> is fantastic! After students
recorded their reading, SE showed their band and scoring they had <strong>attained automatically and instantaneously</strong>.
The video and SE Feedback helped the students to improve their reading
aloud. I found the feedback given almost the same as my own assessment
when I listened to the students’ recording.” – Primary School Teacher</p>

<h4>Interactive Tools that Drive Student Engagement</h4>
<p>“The <strong>ITT tool</strong> was instrumental in<strong> engaging every student </strong>as
every question posed required students to discuss in pairs before penning
their responses on ITT. This allowed me to conduct a whole class discussion
and build upon their mathematical ideas with the use of Talk moves. Students
were able to connect real experiences with mathematical ideas, which <strong>increased student engagement</strong>.”

<h4>Smart Feedback that Transforms Writing Assessment</h4>
<p>“I used the ‘<strong>Short Answer Feedback Assistant</strong>’ on SLS
for a recent writing activity, and WOW – the feedback that it generated
was <strong>incredibly precise and helpful</strong>. Instead of repeating
myself endlessly, I can now provide students with <strong>clear, targeted feedback </strong>directly
from the tool. The result? Less frustration for me and more actionable
insights for my students.” – <em>Primary School Teacher</em>
