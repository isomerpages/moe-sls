General Rules
-----

---

1. **Objective Cards**
    
     These cards describe scenarios. Achieve the objective by fulfilling the two Key Applications of Technology shown.
2. **Learning Experience Type Cards**
    
    These cards specify the Learning Experience that you intend to provide for your students through each lesson. These cards do not have in-game effects but help to guide conversations during post-game facilitation.
3. **Activity Cards**
    
    These cards consist of Activity and Quiz cards. Activities can contain all components while Quizzes can only contain question components.
    
    *Note: Rules tagged to the Competitive Mode Icon only applies in the Competitive Mode.*
4. **Build Cards (Components and Elements)**
    
     Build cards consist of three types of cards - **Component (navy)**, **Element (blue)**, **Special (gray)**. Special cards will only be used in Competitive Mode.
    
    The component and element cards mirror the Components and Elements found in SLS.
    
    These cards can be stacked to form **combinations** - one Component card and up to three unique Element cards. Descriptions on the cards will show the compatibility of the cards.
    
    **How to play Build Cards?**
    
    **Dos**
    
    
    - Do ensure element cards stacked on the component card are compatible.
    - Do stack up to three unique element cards on the component card to form a combination.
    - Do fulfil requirements on the component cards.
     
    **Don'ts**
    
    
    - Don't stack component cards above element cards.
    - Don't play element cards without component cards
    - Don't stack component cards on top of one another.
    - Don't stack identical element cards on the same component cards
    
    **Exception**
    
    
    - The Subgroup Access element card should be played on an Activity or Quiz card instead.
