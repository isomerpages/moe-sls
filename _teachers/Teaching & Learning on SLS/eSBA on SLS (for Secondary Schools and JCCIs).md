<h3>e-SBA on SLS </h3>
<p>The fundamental principle of e-assessment remains the same as it is for
pen-and-paper mode. Key principles of fairness, reliability and validity
remain central when deciding the appropriate mode of and approach to assessments.
Where appropriate, schools can choose to implement school-based e-assessments
(e-SBAs) via SLS.</p>
<p>For subjects with a National e-examination component, schools can refer
to these subject specific guides (requires iCON account) in using SLS to
conduct e-assessments in an exam setting:</p>

<p>Schools can also refer to the steps below when implementing e-SBA via
SLS:</p>

 <summary><h4>e-Author</h4></summary>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a teacher-marked quiz in SLS. Closed-ended
questions (such as MCQ, Fill-In-The-Blank) will still be auto-marked. A
teacher-marked quiz, allows the teacher to decide when to release the quiz
to the students, just like the pen and paper test or exam.</p>

the SLS assessment page.</p>

checking.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If students accidentally submit without completing,
the teacher can un-submit the assessment and it will be returned to the
students for them to complete the remaining questions.</p>

	<summary><h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4></summary>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I print the scripts?</p>
<p>The system currently does not support the printing of students’ scripts
for marking. Teachers are encouraged to make use of the e-marking features
such as commenting and use of rubrics with auto-computation of marks.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I download the marks and responses?</p>
<p>At “Monitor Assignment”, download Marks and Responses in separate MSExcel
files.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I specify all possible answers for the editing
question (English Language)?</p>
<p>Specify all possible answers and indicate that answers need not be case
sensitive. However, as there may be other unanticipated but acceptable
answers arising from minor misspelling, any subsequent changes to the marking
scheme will need to be separately processed offline. Teachers can identify
additional acceptable responses and manually adjust marks awarded to students
offline.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I over-write the marks allocated for auto-marked
responses?</p>
<p>Any subsequent changes to the marking scheme will need to be separately
processed offline. Teachers can identify additional acceptable responses
and manually adjust marks awarded to students offline.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I create a URL Shortener for the SLS Assessment
URL?</p>
<p>Teachers can consider using a URL Shortener. If the URL Shortener is used,
please whitelist the URL in the Service Request Form when making an application
for the Lockdown Account. For example,</p>
<p>• whitelist <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://bitly.com</a> if
bitly is used</p>
<p>• whitelist <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg</a> if
<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg</a>is used</p>
