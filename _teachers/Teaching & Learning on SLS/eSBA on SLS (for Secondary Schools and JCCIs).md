<h1>e-SBA on SLS</h1>
<p>The fundamental principle of e-assessment remains the same as it is for pen-and-paper mode. Key principles of fairness, reliability and validity remain central when deciding the appropriate mode of and approach to assessments. Where appropriate, schools can choose to implement school-based e-assessments (e-SBAs) via SLS.</p>

<p class="demoTitle">For subjects with a National e-Examination component, schools should have received the guide from the respective subject branches. Please approach the respective CPDD/SDCD subject branches to get the latest copy.</p>

<p>Schools can also refer to the steps below when implementing e-SBA via SLS:</p>
<details>
<summary><h4 style="margin: 0; display: inline;">e-Author</h4></summary>
<p>1. Create a teacher-marked quiz in SLS. Closed-ended questions (such as MCQ, Fill-In-The-Blank) will still be auto-marked. A teacher-marked quiz, allows the teacher to decide when to release the quiz to the students, just like the pen and paper test or exam.</p>

<p>3. Setters may wish to adopt current practices of setting the paper in hardcopy format and follow through with the hardcopy vetting process.</p>
<p>4. E-author the final version of the vetted paper in SLS and organise a review session to finalise the e-version.</p>

<summary><h4 style="margin: 0; display: inline;">Frequently Asked Questions</h4></summary>
<p>1. Can I print the scripts?</p>
<p>The system currently does not support the printing of students' scripts
for marking. Teachers are encouraged to make use of the e-marking features
such as commenting and use of rubrics with auto-computation of marks.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I download the marks and responses?</p>
<p>At "Monitor Assignment", download Marks and Responses in separate MSExcel
files.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I specify all possible answers for the editing
question (English Language)?</p>
<p>Specify all possible answers and indicate that answers need not be case
sensitive. However, as there may be other unanticipated but acceptable
answers arising from minor misspelling, any subsequent changes to the marking
scheme will need to be separately processed offline. Teachers can identify
additional acceptable responses and manually adjust marks awarded to students
offline.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I over-write the marks allocated for auto-marked
responses?</p>
<p>Any subsequent changes to the marking scheme will need to be separately
processed offline. Teachers can identify additional acceptable responses
and manually adjust marks awarded to students offline.</p>
