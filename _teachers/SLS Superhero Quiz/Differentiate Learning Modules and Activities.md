<h1 class="page-title">Differentiate Learning Modules and Activities (#Differentiate_with_SLS)</h1>
  <h2>What it is</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Teachers can make use of features on SLS to enable greater differentiation of learning to place, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Differentiation of content</li>
    <li>Differentiation of process</li>
    <li>Differentiation of product</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>Features that support differentiation include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Subgroups<ul>
            <li>Assignment by subgroups</li>
            <li>Activity Access</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Conditional Section Access</li>
    <li>Optional Activities</li>
    <li>Progressive Quiz</li>
</ul>
  
  <h2>Why do it</h2>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li>By using a single feature or a combination of features to support differentiation, we can respond to our students’ readiness, interests, and learning profiles.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How to do it</h2>
  <hr><ol>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/differentiate/create-subgroups/">Subgroups</a>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Teachers can purposefully group students to differentiate instructions.</li>
            <li>By assigning subgroups, you can decide which activities each subgroup should attempt.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/differentiate/add-activity-quiz-section-prerequisites/">Conditional section access</a>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Allow students to pace themselves by enabling conditional section access.</li>
            <li>This way, sections that you select will be locked until students complete the required section.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/personalise/set-optional-activities-and-quizzes/">Optional Activities</a>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Depending on your students’ readiness, you could create optional activities to scaffold or enrich your students’ learning.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assess/create-quizzes/">Progressive quiz</a>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>In your Module, create a progressive quiz so that students receive marks and feedback after each question within.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
