  <h2>What it is</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>You can use SLS to support in-class teaching by enabling students to work together on the same assignment or rewarding their good behavior.</p>
  
  <h2>Why use it</h2>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li>Encourage students to carry out live group discussions and submit it as a team.</li>
    <li>Integrate gamified Modules with in-class teaching by manually awarding XP, Game Story, and Achievements.</li>
    <li>Get a quick sensing of students' thoughts and opinions by getting them to post in the Class Forum or doing a quick Poll in a Module.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How to do it</h2>

    <li>
      <ul>Activity Teams

          <li>Teachers can choose to allow students to submit assignments as one team.</li>
