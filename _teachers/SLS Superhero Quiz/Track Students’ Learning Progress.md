<h2>What it is</h2>
<hr>
<p>Learning Progress shows the overall progress (in terms of marks) of students in a Class Group based on their attempted assignments. You can select questions you wish to monitor and view them from the Learning Progress page.</p>
<h2>Why do it</h2>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li>You can discuss learning outcomes that your students have done poorly in and identify students who need more remediation.</li>
    <li>You can click on specific questions or students to investigate specific areas that the students are struggling in.</li>
    <li>HODs and SHs can identify broader clusters of learning gaps to plan structured interventions.</li>
    <li>HODs and SHs can point to unexpected student performance and identify if the cause is pedagogical, motivational, or professional, and correct these issues early before summative assessments.</li>
  </ul>
