<h2>What it is</h2>
<hr>
<p>In a teachers-only Class Group, you can combine efforts to easily co-create and co-edit Lessons collaboratively.</p>
<h2>Why do it</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>By working on a single lesson in SLS, you and your colleagues do not have to shuffle between different documents and resources to co-create a lesson.</li>
  <li>Parking this lesson in a Class Group helps you and your colleagues to save time as Teachers within the Class Group will be able to access this lesson.</li>
  <li>Teachers who wish to further adapt your co-created lesson can easily make a copy to their personal My Drive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to do it</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/create-class-groups/">In a teachers-only Class Group</a>, add Teachers into your Class Group and assign them with Teacher roles, Student roles or both.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the ‘Resources’ tab and create a new Resource, or work on an existing Resource.</li>
  <li>Open the lesson you wish to co-create or co-edit and begin editing.</li>
  <li>If you wish to adapt an existing lesson for your personal use, copy it to your My Drive.</li>
</ol>
