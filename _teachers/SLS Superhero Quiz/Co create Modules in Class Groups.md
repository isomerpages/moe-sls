<h2>What it is</h2>
<hr>
<p>In a teachers-only Class Group, you can combine efforts to easily co-create
and co-edit Modules collaboratively.</p>
<h2>Why do it</h2>
<hr>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>By working on a single Module in SLS, you and your colleagues do not have
to shuffle between different documents and resources to co-create a Module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parking this Module in a Class Group helps you and your colleagues to
save time as Teachers within the Class Group will be able to access this
Module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers who wish to further adapt your co-created Module can easily make
a copy to their personal My Drive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to do it</h2>
<hr>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/create-class-groups/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">In a teachers-only Class Group</a>,
add Teachers into your Class Group and assign them with Teacher roles,
Student roles or both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Resources’ tab and create a new Resource, or work on
an existing Resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the Module you wish to co-create or co-edit and begin editing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you wish to adapt an existing Module for your personal use, copy it
to your My Drive.</p>
</li>
</ol>
