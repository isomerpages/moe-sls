  <h2>What it is</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Game Teams encourage students to have fun in a group setting. In groups, students build on content mastery while practicing teamwork and communication skills.</p>
  
  <h2>Why do it</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>In Game Teams, students will have to engage and practice essential group work skills to arrive at a shared conclusion.</li>
    <li>In situations where 1:1 devices are not available for every student, each group can assign one team leader to answer on behalf of the team.</li>
  </ul>
