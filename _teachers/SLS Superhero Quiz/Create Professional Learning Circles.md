<h2>What it is</h2>
<hr>
<p>You can create a Class Group for various learning circles (within your department and school; even interschool and interdivisional learning circles) to share or consolidate resources.</p>
<h2>Why do it</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>Using a Class Group as a repository helps you and your colleagues to save time as everyone can share, co-edit and curate resources together.</li>
  <li>Class Group Resources do not have a due date, so your colleagues can access them anytime.</li>
  <li>Set professional boundaries as separate Class Groups can be created for work with vendors or other teachers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to do it</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/create-class-groups/">Add a new Class Group</a> on the Class Groups page.</li>
  <li>Add Teachers into your Class Group and assign them with the necessary roles (Owner, Co-Teachers, Liaison Teachers, Observers, or <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/add-teachers-as-students-to-a-class-group/">Students</a>).</li>
  <li>Navigate using the tabs to add various resources.</li>
  <li>Teachers in the Class Group can then access the resource and <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/star-resources/">star the resources</a> or activities they wish to save.</li>
  <li>To further organise your resources, you can <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/manage-class-group-resources/">create Categories in the Resources tab</a>).</li>
</ol>
