<h2>What it is</h2>
<hr>
<p>You can implement class-based e-Assessments in a classroom setting using SLS, in place of pen-and-paper assessment.</p>
<h2>Why do it</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>The fundamental principle of e-assessment remains the same it is for pen-and-paper.</li>
  <li>Where appropriate, consider using e-assessment in situations where it can facilitate the assessment delivery at scale, improve accessibility for your students, and provide opportunities for feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to do it</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
  <li>Create a lesson with your assessment questions.</li>
  <li>You can also <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/author/upload-question-and-test-interoperability-qti-files/">upload a digitised exam paper or use an existing digitised exam paper</a>.</li>
<li>After the e-assessment is vetted, <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/assess/set-assignments-as-assessments/">set the Assignment as an Assessment</a>.</li>
</ol>
