<h2>What it is</h2>
<hr>
<p>There are different tools that you can use to guide students in their self-study.</p>
  
  <h2>Why do it</h2>
  <hr>
<p>We can encourage students to be independent and self-directed learners by providing them with a platform where they can have access to ample resources for self-study.</p>

  <h2>How to do it</h2>
  <hr>
  <ol>
    <li><i>(New in R19)</i> The Self-Study List helps students take control of their own learning by consolidating their self-study attempts into one list for easy tracking.</li>
