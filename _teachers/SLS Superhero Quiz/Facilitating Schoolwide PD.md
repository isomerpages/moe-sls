  <h2>What it is</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Teachers and the Professional Development (PD) committee can help to make school-wide PD sessions seamless and easily accessible through Class Groups in SLS.</p>
  
  <h2>Why do it</h2>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li>PD resources can be consolidated into lessons as a systematic way of conducting PD sessions in school.</li>
    <li>Class Groups can act as an aggregating platform where discussion and comments can be accessed via the Forum.</li>
    <li>Using SLS for PD benefits you and your colleagues through familiarization of the Class Group feature and increases confidence in using SLS.</li>
    <li><i>(New in R19)</i> The SLS Planner helps teachers and the PD committee to plan ahead by attaching assignments or resources in a selected date cell. Recurring events can also be created for PD sessions.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How to do it</h2>
  <hr>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a lesson or series of lessons for PD and organize them in a folder in My Drive.</li>
    <li>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/sls/teachers/user-guide/vle/teacher/ClassGroupManagement/CreateGroup.html">your school PD Class Group, assign these lesson(s)</a>, with pre-defined Start and End dates, according to the PD schedule in school.</li>
    <li>Teachers (as Students) will be notified via SLS Announcements to complete the assignments.</li>
    <li>Using the Lesson Heatmap, PD facilitators can bring up responses for further discussion.</li>
    <li>Teachers can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/sls/teachers/user-guide/vle/teacher/ClassGroupManagement/PostComment.html">extend their learning further by creating posts in the Class Group Forum</a> to generate discussions.</li>
  </ol>
