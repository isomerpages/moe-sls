<h1 class="page-title">Facilitating School-wide PD (#Organise_with_SLS)</h1>
  <h2>What it is</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Teachers and the Professional Development (PD) committee can help to make school-wide PD sessions seamless and easily accessible through Class Groups in SLS.</p>
  
  <h2>Why do it</h2>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li>PD resources can be consolidated into Modules as a systematic way of conducting PD sessions in school.</li>
    <li>Class Groups can act as an aggregating platform where discussion and comments can be accessed via the Forum.</li>
    <li>Using SLS for PD benefits you and your colleagues through familiarization of the Class Group feature and increases confidence in using SLS.</li>
    <li><i>(New in R19)</i> The SLS Planner helps teachers and the PD committee to plan ahead by attaching assignments or resources in a selected date cell. Recurring events can also be created for PD sessions.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How to do it</h2>
  <hr>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a Module or series of Modules for PD and organise them in a folder in My Drive.</li>
    <li>From <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/create-class-groups/">your school PD Class Group, assign these Module(s)</a>, with pre-defined Start and End dates, according to the PD schedule in school.</li>
    <li>Teachers (as Students) will be notified via SLS Announcements to complete the assignments.</li>
    <li>Using the Monitor Assignment page, PD facilitators can bring up responses for further discussion.</li>
    <li>Teachers can <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/collaborate/about-the-forum/">extend their learning further by creating posts in the Class Group Forum</a> to generate discussions.</li>
  </ol>

<ul>
<li>Create differentiated access to sections within the Module, such as by department, by <a target="_blank" href="/teacher-user-guide/differentiate/create-subgroups/">assigning Subgroups</a>.</li>              
</ul>
