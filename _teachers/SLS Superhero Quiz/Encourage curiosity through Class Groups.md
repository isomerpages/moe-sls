<h1 class="page-title">Encourage curiosity through Class Groups (#Discover_with_SLS)</h1>
<hr>

  <h2>What it is</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Extend learning in Class Groups and empower students to share their perspectives by facilitating discussions in the Forum.</p>
  
  <h2>Why do it</h2>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li>Many of us will experience "teachable moments" in the classroom. Use features within the Class Group to extend these moments.</li>
    <li>Through organization of resources in your Class Group, you can cater to diverse students' learning needs.</li>
    <li>Resources in Class Groups have no End Date, so students can use these supplementary resources for self-study at their preferred pacing.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How to do it</h2>
  <hr>
  <ol>
    <li>In your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/sls/teachers/user-guide/vle/teacher/ClassGroupManagement/AboutGroupResources.html">Class Group</a>, add supplementary resources from the MOE Library, Community Gallery, or My Drive.</li>
    <li>For clarity, consider organizing these resources into Categories so that students can access them easily.</li>
    <li>Extend your students' learning by inviting them to post questions and ideas on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/sls/teachers/user-guide/vle/teacher/ClassGroupManagement/AboutForum.html">Class Group Forum</a>. You can even provide guidance by starting a Forum post or poll.</li>
    <li>To enrich the discussion, encourage your students to comment on other Forum posts.</li>
  </ol>
